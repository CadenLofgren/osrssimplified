===== Pay-to-play melee training =====
This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints through melee combat.

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food or use food that heals more.

General training notes
The Waterfall Quest will get you to both 30 Attack and Strength if completed at level 3 combat.
Since experience rates are largely influenced by Strength level and strength bonus, it is optimal to maintain balanced melee stats until reaching the minimum requirements for the best-in-slot weapon and equipment. After this, prioritizing Strength until 99, followed by Attack and finally Defence, will result in the fastest route to max melee stats. For example, when training in the Nightmare Zone with Obsidian Armour, a Berserker Necklace, and the Toktz-Xil-Ak, Attack and Defence should remain at 60 until reaching 99 Strength for optimal experience gains.
Strength can be trained without training Hitpoints with barbarian fishing and at the Blast Furnace pump, which requires 30 Strength.
Defence can be trained by using Ancient Magicks on defensive or chinchompas on Long fuse against Maniacal monkeys for more experience per hour than using melee.
Players can complete Slayer tasks to train Slayer while simultaneously training combat stats. This is an effective combat training method as well as providing profit in most cases.
When fighting dangerous monsters it is suggested to bring a teleportation tablet or if your Magic level is high enough, teleportation runes in order to quickly escape. Note that a tablet can be more easily clicked from your inventory and takes up less space than runes for a teleport spell.

To start off, it is strongly recommended to complete quests that give a lot of melee experience. This allows players to wear much better equipment and have much higher damage output when they start training.

A lot of the quests are quick to complete and only have a few requirements. Most of them include boss fights, which can be made trivial with protection prayers, and many of the bosses can be safespotted with Magic or Ranged. It is strongly recommended to complete Witch's House to get Hitpoints higher.

The recommended quests for early melee experience are listed in the table below. Completing all of them would give the player a total of 65,275 Attack, 27,537.5 Strength, and 15,300 Defence experience. This would get the player up to level 45 Attack, level 37 Strength, and level 31 Defence without doing any melee training.

Fastest Experience

 Levels 1-30: Questing 
Completing the Waterfall Quest at level 1 Attack and Strength will instantly bring the player to level 30 in strength and attack.  This quest has no requirements, making it the fastest way to train a brand-new account to these levels, skipping much of the slow low-level training. However, there are several aggressive and hard-hitting monsters during the quest, so players may alternatively want to train some Defence and Hitpoints levels to make the quest safer. Completing the Recommended quests will get the player up to level 45 Attack, level 37 Strength, and level 31 Defence.

Levels 30 to 50: Crabs

Levels 50-70: Nightmare Zone - Normal Rumble

Levels 70-99:  Nightmare Zone
Since Dharok's potential is dependent on having high max , it becomes optimal at . Otherwise, the combination of Obsidian Armour, a Berserker Necklace, and the Toktz-Xil-Ak is optimal. 

Other methods
You may use these if the above methods are too crowded or otherwise not available. However, they are not as good as the other methods.

It is not recommended to train melee for profit at low levels. It is usually better to train with crabs, Slayer, or the Nightmare Zone and do something else to make money for overall more efficient play. For example, killing Hobgoblins for two hours will give both less money and less experience than spinning flax for one hour and training on crabs for one hour. Low-level players looking to make money for early gear should check out the Money-making guide.

Here are some easy options for training melee if you do want to kill monsters for profit and still get decent experience rates.
Levels 1 to 10: Chickens

Levels 10 to 60: Rock Crabs

Levels 30 to 60: Chaos druids

 Levels 30 to 81: Ogres 

Levels 40 to 60: Moss giants

Levels 60 to 70: Wilderness Slayer

Levels 70 to 99: Slayer

 Gargoyles 

Levels 60/70 to 99: Scurrius

 Levels 60/70 to 99: Sulphur Naguas 

 Levels 60/70 to 99: Pest Control 

Levels 90 to 99: Rune dragons

Equipment choice
Items will be listed in order of how much they increase general melee damage per second. In nearly all cases, optimising for offensive stats is more effective than optimising for defensive or balanced stats, especially when fighting the low-offence, high-hp monsters on this list. In addition, optimising for Strength is usually better than optimising for accuracy except against high-Defence monsters.
Head-slot items in order of effectiveness

 Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
 Three of these items provide the same Strength bonus of +3, so choose between them based on their other stats such as their Defence or availability. Note that these Strength-boosting helmets are almost always better than helmets that only provide accuracy, such as the warrior helm, for general training.
 When training Slayer, a Slayer helm (or black mask) will always provide the greatest damage increase over any of these.

Cape-slot items in order of effectiveness

If the player does not have access to any of these, an obsidian cape or a Cape of Accomplishment can be used instead due to their moderate Defence bonuses, however, they will not increase damage. The Ardougne cloak also provides a stab accuracy bonus and a moderate Prayer bonus.

Neck-slot items in order of effectiveness

Depending on your stats, for monsters with low Defence, an amulet of Strength can be better than an amulet of power, amulet of glory, or even an amulet of fury.
When fighting undead monsters and not using a Slayer helmet, the salve amulet and its upgraded version the salve amulet (e) are the best neck-slot items.

Body-slot items in order of effectiveness

Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
Five of these items provide the same Strength bonus, but the Oathplate chest and Bandos chestplate have much better defence.

Shield-slot items in order of effectiveness

When fighting dragons, a Dragonfire shield is the best melee offhand item due to its ability to block dragonfire while having high Strength and Defence bonuses. IMPORTANT: The "Uncharged" Dragonfire shield has about 1/3 the defensive characteristics of the charged shield. If the dragonfire protection and high Defence are not needed, defenders are better due to their accuracy bonuses.

As defenders require access to the Warriors' Guild and thus a combined Attack and Strength level of 130 (for example, level 65 in both), the Toktz-ket-xil or dragonfire shield should be used until that requirement is met. If the required Defence levels for those items (60 and 75 respectively) aren't met, a book of war can be used.

Legs-slot items in order of effectiveness

Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
Items shown without strength bonus are included to show defensive stats and give less expensive options.

Hands-slot items in order of effectiveness

Feet-slot items in order of effectiveness

Ring-slot items in order of effectiveness

Rings should be imbued as soon as possible. Also note that the Warrior, Tyrannical, and Treasonous rings only benefit one attacking style each, while the Brimstone ring benefits all melee combat. If the player cannot afford any of these rings, a ring of wealth is a decent alternative to help improve rare drop table rolls and pick up coins, but it does not increase damage. Low level players can benefit from a ring of recoil, as 10% + 1 of the damage received by the player (rounded down) is dealt to the attacker, and always recoils at least 1 damage when the player is hit.

Weapon choice
Choosing a weapon

In most cases, choosing a weapon with an attack speed of 2.4 seconds (4 ticks) will be the best choice for dealing the highest damage per second. Slower weapons almost always give less experience overall against low-defence monsters, even if they do more damage per hit, but may deal more against high-defence monsters.
Monster vulnerability may cause certain weapons to perform better than their stats suggest. For example, most dragons are weak to Stab, making the otherwise weaker zamorakian hasta a better choice than the abyssal whip when fighting them. Check a monster's wiki page to see its defensive bonuses and consider picking a weapon it is weak to.

Training weapons in order of effectiveness
Note: All one-handed weapons in this table will have their stats displayed as if they were paired with an avernic defender to make a fair comparison to two-handed weapons.
Note: Some Crush weapons in this table will have stats displayed as paired with the inquisitor's armour set and its respective defender, if applicable, to more easily showcase the enhancements the set effect offers to weapons that deliver Crush attacks.

If you do not have access to a shield at all, such as if you do not want to risk an additional item in the Wilderness or you have not yet unlocked the requirements for certain offhand equipment, some fast two-handed weapons like the Saradomin sword become worth using.

The weapons listed here with level requirements of less than 70 Attack will include the dragon defender bonuses instead of the Avernic one, while weapons with a requirement of less than 60 will not include the bonuses of a defender, as it is unlikely that someone using one of these low level weapons would have access to one due to the 130 Attack+Strength requirement. As noted above, players with 60 Defence without access to defenders should be using the Toktz-ket-xil.

Each Soul Stack gives the player a +6% boost to their Strength level. Maintaining 5 soul stacks at all times, and not using the "Behead" special attack is optimal while training. It does not degrade and it primarily uses the Slash attack style.82 AttackStabAll Stats +135 Stab+111 StrengthThis weapon will be better than the ghrazi rapier on monsters that have very high Defence bonuses due to its passive effects.80 AttackSlashStrength, DefenceAll Stats on Controlled +80 Stab+132 Slash+142 StrengthTwo-handed weapon with a slightly slower attack speed of 3 seconds instead of 2.4 like most other weapons listed. Despite this, it is better than the other 80 Attack weapons when used with lower Strength bonus gear while being far cheaper.80 AttackStabAll Stats +124 Stab+97 StrengthThis is one of the best melee training weapons. Its Strength bonus is tied with the inquisitor's mace and the blade of Saeldor. It does not degrade and it primarily uses the Stab attack style. It is worth mentioning the player can attack with the Ghrazi Rapier every 2.4 seconds as opposed to the slightly slower attack rate of Osmumten's fang (every 3.0 seconds).80 AttackCrushAll Stats +123 Crush+97 StrengthThis is one of the best melee training weapons. Its Strength bonus is tied with the ghrazi rapier and the blade of Saeldor. It does not degrade and it primarily uses the Crush attack style.
When combined with the inquisitor's armour, the weapon's enhanced Strength bonus and significantly improved accuracy become devastating against enemies with high Defence. The four-tick weapon speed and the capability to train all melee stats render it one of the best melee weapons available.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +155 Crush+107 Strength80 AttackSlashAll Stats +123 Slash+97 StrengthThis is one of the best melee training weapons. Its Strength bonus is tied with the ghrazi rapier and the inquisitor's mace. However, it must be charged with crystal shards, which can be obtained from either doing various activities around Prifddinas or from exchanging certain crystal seeds with Amrod. This effectively makes the sword require Song of the Elves to use. Each shard grants 100 charges; the weapon can store up to 20,000 charges and loses one charge with each hit (regardless of whether the hit is successful or not). One can bring it and 1,000 crystal shards to a singing bowl to make blade of Saeldor (c), which is non-degradable and non-tradeable (requires level 82 Crafting and Smithing).75 AttackSlashAll stats +109 Slash+88 StrengthThis is the best non-degradable weapon for training Strength at level 75.

The special attack of the Voidwaker is a magic attack and grants Magic and Hitpoints skill experience.75 AttackSlashAttack, DefenceAll Stats on Controlled +119 Slash+94 StrengthWhile it is the fourth strongest one handed four tick weapon in the game, the tentacle's cost per attack, of , makes training far more expensive, but provides a boost of +8 Slash and +4 Strength. The costs adds up to  coins per hour, completely degrading after 10,000 hits.

Created by combining an abyssal whip with a kraken tentacle.70 AttackSlashAttack, DefenceAll Stats on Controlled +111 Slash+90 StrengthThis is the most common training weapon, especially considering that it is affordable and does not degrade. The whip is the second-strongest non-degradable Attack and Defence training weapon in the game. Using this weapon on Controlled is an easy, but slower way to reach 99 Attack, Strength, and Defence since all the experience is spread across these three skills. One disadvantage of the abyssal whip is that it cannot train Strength without training Attack and Defence at the same time, so pures should avoid using it to train.75 AttackSlashStrength +100 Slash+88 StrengthSimilar to the abyssal tentacle, this weapon degrades. Each hit costs , costing  per hour of constant use. This is the third-best Strength training weapon in the game. After 10,000 hits, the sword crumbles to dust, and you get the Tear back.

Not specifically for sale in the Grand Exchange. Created by combining a Saradomin sword with a Saradomin's tear.70 Attack70 StrengthCrushStrength +102 Crush+85 StrengthThis is the second-best non-degradable Strength training weapon. It is very useful when fighting a monster with a vulnerability to Crush weapons, such as Revenants and Vet'ion. However, the fairly high cost and being only a slight upgrade over more affordable weapons make it a less popular choice for strength training.
If you can afford to combine this weapon with the inquisitor's armour set, the significantly improved accuracy and slightly improved damage make this weapon even more powerful.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +135 Crush+95 Strength70 AttackBarbarian TrainingStabDefenceAll stats on Controlled +115 Stab+83 StrengthThis weapon is not generally chosen for everyday training due to only being able to train on controlled or defensive. It is both weaker and more expensive than the abyssal whip. It is primarily used against monsters with a weakness to Stab, such as all types of dragons. It also has a decent Crush bonus, so it can be used as an alternative to the Abyssal bludgeon for fighting Crush-weak enemies like Kalphites and Vet'ion.70 AttackStabStrength +105 Stab+83 StrengthThe fourth-best one-handed Strength training weapon. It should not be used for Attack training unless a Stab weapon is needed.75 Attack75 MagicSlashStrength +99 Slash+80 StrengthThe fifth-best one-handed Strength training weapon. It is more accurate with a defender than the next-best Strength training weapon, the Saradomin sword, but has lower Strength. This makes the staff better against high-defence monsters, but it is much less affordable. Also, it is strictly worse than the abyssal dagger, which should usually be used instead unless a slash weapon is needed.70 AttackSlashStrength +82 Slash+82 StrengthThe Saradomin sword is a much more affordable Strength training weapon than anything above it on this list. Against lower-defence monsters such as Yaks, the Saradomin sword will on average do higher damage per second than the staff of the dead due to its higher Strength. However, this sword's lack of a shield and the staff's magic capabilities and melee accuracy make the staff usually more desirable if you can afford it.Attack & Strength Bonus (with Dragon Defender, if applicable)65 AttackSlashAll Stats +129 Slash+113 StrengthThe zombie axe has a 5-tick weapon speed and does slightly less DPS than the abyssal whip against enemies with low Defence; however, it has a higher potential DPS against enemies with high Defence or that are weak to Crush. 
The inquisitor's armour set makes the Crush style attack of the zombie axe slightly more powerful and extremely accurate.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +145 Crush+123 Strength65 AttackCrushStrength +93 Crush+76 StrengthThe Sarachnis cudgel is generally not favoured for training due to its marginal advantages over the dragon scimitar and its requirement of 5 additional Attack levels to wield. Compared to higher-tier weapons requiring 70+ Attack, like the Saradomin sword and staff of the dead, it falls short in melee Strength. Nonetheless, the cudgel may have the upper hand in rare situations where the target is susceptible to Crush attacks.
The inquisitor's armour set enhances the Crush Style attacks of the Sarachnis cudgel, increasing both power and accuracy.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +125 Crush+86 Strength60 AttackCrushStrength +91 Crush+72 StrengthThis weapon is on par with the dragon scimitar as the best training weapon for all attack styles at level 60 Attack, requiring no charging or quest completion. When charged with revenant ether, it grants a 50% boost in melee accuracy and damage against NPCs in the Wilderness, often surpassing other weapons in training speed if used there. However, it is notably more expensive than the dragon scimitar and carries the risk of losing money through charges if the user is killed in the Wilderness. Moreover, when used with any of the defenders, the mace's accuracy is slightly inferior to that of the dragon scimitar, as defenders tend to offer greater offensive bonuses for Stab/Slash than for Crush.
The inquisitor's armour set significantly enhances the accuracy and damage of Viggora's chainmace by providing a buff to its base Crush and Strength bonus. This amplifies the chainmace's passive 50% boost in accuracy and damage against Wilderness NPCs, particularly when combined with either the salve amulet or the Slayer helmet. This is not advised though as this would be a significant risk.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +122 Crush+82 Strength60 AttackMonkey Madness ISlashAll Stats +91 Slash+72 StrengthThis is tied for the best training weapon for all attack styles at level 60 with the Viggora's chainmace. In addition, the dragon scimitar is a much cheaper alternative to all of the weapons listed above, making it very popular even among some high level players. For Attack and Defence training, it should be replaced with the abyssal whip as soon as one can afford and equip it.60 AttackStabAll Stats +90 Stab+69 StrengthThis is comparable to the dragon scimitar in stats, but without the quest requirement of Monkey Madness I.65 Attack55 SlayerCrushStrength +96 Slash+95 Crush+98 StrengthThis 5-tick weapon holds the third-highest Strength bonus for single-handed weapons. It is particularly effective against creatures susceptible to Crush damage and is only outperformed by the zombie axe within its level category.
The inquisitor's armour set enhances the Crush style attack of the leaf-bladed battleaxe, increasing its power and accuracy significantly. Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +127 Crush+108 Strength60 AttackLost CitySlashAll Stats +93 Slash+77 StrengthA viable alternate training weapon before being able to use the dragon scimitar since Monkey Madness I is a much longer and harder quest than Lost City. It should be noted that the dragon longsword attacks 1 game tick slower than the dragon scimitar, making it less damage per second than the dragon scimitar for training.Attack & Strength Bonus (No Defender)55 AttackSlashAll Stats +72 Slash+64 StrengthThis is the best melee training weapon at 55 Attack, providing the highest Strength bonus before 60 Attack while being fairly cheap.50 Attack55 SlayerStabAll Stats +67 Stab+50 StrengthThis weapon is the second best option at 50 Attack, behind the granite hammer.50 Attack50 StrengthCrushAll Stats +57 Crush+56 StrengthThis is the best melee training weapon at 50 Attack and Strength.

Other equipment options
Obsidian equipment + Berserker necklace
Wearing the obsidian platebody, obsidian platelegs, and the obsidian helmet gives a 10% damage and accuracy bonus to melee obsidian weapons. Wearing the berserker necklace also gives another 20% damage bonus to Obsidian weapons. Combining all four of these items with the Toktz-xil-ak (Obsidian sword) can give faster experience rates than anything in the table above against low-defence monsters, such as those in the Nightmare Zone. However, the set has below-average Defence and does not allow the use of a Slayer helmet. If the player cannot use all five items, they should not be using the Toktz-xil-ak.
Void knight equipment
Wearing the Void melee helm with the full Void Knight equipment set gives a 10% melee damage and accuracy bonus. This bonus accuracy makes it good against certain high-defence monsters like the Corporeal Beast. It is a good alternative for players with 42 combat stats who do not have access to high-Strength gear. However, this set gives less Strength than other melee equipment and has significantly lower melee and ranged Defence, making it usually worse for training than high-strength gear.
Dharok the Wretched's equipment
Wearing a full set of Dharok the Wretched's equipment gives the set effect of increasing the player's damage the lower their remaining Hitpoints are. Using a dwarven rock cake or locator orb the player can intentionally keep their health at 1 hp while using protection prayers to block all forms of damage. If the player has a source of Prayer or damage block, such as by using Prayer potions, absorptions (Nightmare Zone only), or an altar, the player can safely use the set's effect to deal very high amounts of damage and gain fast experience. However, the set degrades after 15 hours of use and must be repaired to keep its stats.
Guthan the Infested's equipment
Wearing a full set of Guthan the Infested's equipment gives the set effect of a 25% chance to heal the player by the damage dealt. This set deals less damage than some of the best options on the list, but it allows players to train for long periods without banking to heal. Players can bring the four pieces in their inventory, train on their normal high-strength equipment, and switch to the Guthan's equipment only when their health gets low. Popular monsters for this tactic are gargoyles, nechryael, and bandits. However, the set degrades after 15 hours of use and must be repaired to keep its stats.

===== Free-to-play melee training =====
This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints through melee combat in free-to-play.

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level, but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food, or use food that heals more.

Equipment choice
Players should always use the best scimitar they can equip as scimitars offer the highest damage per second of any other type of free-to-play melee weapon due to their high speed and high strength bonus. Use the amulet of strength if it gives a higher max hit for your Strength level, otherwise use the amulet of power for more accuracy, defence, and especially if it provides the same maximum damage as the amulet of strength at certain Strength levels with certain attack styles. Use full melee armour sets against monsters that use melee, and ranged armour against monsters that use magic. A chainbody is more useful than a platebody against monsters that use crush.

As for boots, you may start off with fancy boots or fighting boots (both have same stats as members' bronze boots) that are awarded in the Stronghold of Security, or leather boots if you don't want to reclaim the stronghold boots when you die. The best-in-slot boots for melee combat is decorative boots (gold) for its melee defence and its +1 Strength bonus (same stats as members' adamant boots). However, the time it takes to obtain gold decorative boots (400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time spent to train melee skills to 99 but if you quickly want more defence bonus over fancy or fighting boots to tank more hits, decorative boots (red) (same stats as members' steel boots) is a decent defence upgrade with +4 more defence bonus than fancy/fighting boots that can easily be obtained within a few Castle Wars matches (4 castle wars tickets) and with a bit more time put into Castle Wars, decorative boots (white) (same stats as members' mithril boots, 40 castle wars tickets) is a good defence upgrade with +3 more defence bonuses than red boots if you don't wish to spend a lot of time going for decorative boots (gold) for the gold boots' +1 Strength Bonus.

As for capes, all coloured capes, team capes, and the cabbage cape share the same defence bonus and are best-in-slot for free-to-play players. For gloves, gilded d'hide vambraces are best-in-slot but require 40 Ranged to equip and may be prohibitively expensive for some players. A cheaper alternative is green d'hide vambraces, otherwise the next best choice is leather vambraces or leather/coloured gloves depending on enemy attack style until 40 Ranged is achieved.

Maximum hit

Rune scimitars offer the best damage per second (DPS) in free-to-play and is recommended to use for melee training from Level 40 Attack and all melee skill onwards so it is recommended to achieve Level 40 Attack as soon as possible. Training Attack slightly increases the attack accuracy of your hits. However, training Strength is important for increasing maximum damage which also increases damage per second.

To further increase damage per second, there are three free-to-play neck slot items that can provide attack and/or strength bonuses including amulet of accuracy, amulet of power, and amulet of strength. If the player cannot afford an amulet of power or if an ironman cannot acquire an amulet of strength ( to craft a ruby amulet and  for Lvl-3 Enchant) or an amulet of power ( to craft a diamond amulet and  for Lvl-4 Enchant), the amulet of accuracy from Imp Catcher is a weaker alternative to the amulet of power (without a strength bonus) until the player can acquire one of the other two amulets.

The skill to train first depends on the player's preference and a preferential example could be to keep melee skills (and Defence) within five or ten levels of each other while prioritising one combat skill over the others. If the player wants to deal the most damage first, the player would prioritise training Strength until they achieve a new maximum hit for a different attack style to train the next combat skill with the amulet of power.

Strength levels 1 to 99
The following tables below will determine the maximum of damage certain weapons can inflict on enemies at certain attack styles with the following amulets at certain Strength levels so that you can determine which enchanted amulet you should use at certain Strength levels. The aggressive attack style adds an invisible +3 Strength level boost, the amulet of power adds a +6 Melee Strength bonus, and the amulet of strength adds a +10 Melee Strength bonus. Amulet of accuracy is not included in the table since it does not provide a strength bonus, and even though gold decorative boots from Castle Wars provide a Melee Strength bonus of +1 with higher defence bonuses than fighting boots/fancy boots, the amount of time it takes to acquire the boots (over 40 hours if winning Castle Wars every time to 400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time to train Attack, Strength, and Defence to 99 and so the tables will not account for gold decorative boots' bonus.

Strength levels higher than 99 are strength boosts from the use of beer or strength potion. At level 99 Strength, a strength potion will temporarily boost strength up to 111.

Barronite mace
Free-to-play ironmen can only acquire a rune scimitar through smithing at level 90 Smithing (or level 89 Smithing with a dwarven stout). Until then, the second best option for free-to-play ironmen to effectively train melee combat is barronite mace, which can be obtained by exchanging a barronite guard, barronite handle, barronite head, and 1,500 barronite shards to Ramarno in the Ruins of Camdozaal after the completion of Below Ice Mountain.

Rune sword
The third best option would be the rune sword, or alternatively the rune mace at certain Strength levels depending on which amulet you use, both of which can be bought from the Champions' Guild. While rune longswords are stronger and more accurate than rune swords and rune maces, it is slower, resulting in a lower damage per second. Rune swords provide the third best melee damage per second in free-to-play and are good for ironmen to train with until a barronite mace or rune scimitar is obtained.

The maximum hit table below is for the rune sword.

Alternative accounts in Clan Wars
If you have a 1 Defence combat pure and high Hitpoints (80+ HP for example), stock them up with jugs of wine and attack them in the Free-For-All Clan Wars portal. This is the fastest combat training method in free-to-play when done efficiently. This training method is not recommended for players who have not yet made a one-Defence combat pure account and it wouldn't be worth the time training one up just for this training method alone. But it is recommended for alternate accounts created after a high HP one-Defence combat pure account.

Alternatively, wizard's mind bombs can reduce a character's Defence towards 0 Defence but Defence will regenerate by a point every 60 seconds.

Alternative accounts in Castle Wars
Thanks to the castle wars bracelet and castlewars brew, the Castle Wars minigame provides considerable combat bonuses in comparison to the Clan Wars minigame. By attacking a 1 Defence combat pure holding a captured flag, you can achieve the highest maximum melee hits in free-to-play worlds. The alternative account can be healed with bandages without the need to bring any supplies. To make the healing more effective, wear a castle wars bracelet. Note that the healing scales with the Hitpoints level, so to maximise the effect the account needs at least 90 level.

Category:Free-to-play

===== Pay-to-play melee training =====
This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints through melee combat.

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food or use food that heals more.

General training notes
The Waterfall Quest will get you to both 30 Attack and Strength if completed at level 3 combat.
Since experience rates are largely influenced by Strength level and strength bonus, it is optimal to maintain balanced melee stats until reaching the minimum requirements for the best-in-slot weapon and equipment. After this, prioritizing Strength until 99, followed by Attack and finally Defence, will result in the fastest route to max melee stats. For example, when training in the Nightmare Zone with Obsidian Armour, a Berserker Necklace, and the Toktz-Xil-Ak, Attack and Defence should remain at 60 until reaching 99 Strength for optimal experience gains.
Strength can be trained without training Hitpoints with barbarian fishing and at the Blast Furnace pump, which requires 30 Strength.
Defence can be trained by using Ancient Magicks on defensive or chinchompas on Long fuse against Maniacal monkeys for more experience per hour than using melee.
Players can complete Slayer tasks to train Slayer while simultaneously training combat stats. This is an effective combat training method as well as providing profit in most cases.
When fighting dangerous monsters it is suggested to bring a teleportation tablet or if your Magic level is high enough, teleportation runes in order to quickly escape. Note that a tablet can be more easily clicked from your inventory and takes up less space than runes for a teleport spell.

To start off, it is strongly recommended to complete quests that give a lot of melee experience. This allows players to wear much better equipment and have much higher damage output when they start training.

A lot of the quests are quick to complete and only have a few requirements. Most of them include boss fights, which can be made trivial with protection prayers, and many of the bosses can be safespotted with Magic or Ranged. It is strongly recommended to complete Witch's House to get Hitpoints higher.

The recommended quests for early melee experience are listed in the table below. Completing all of them would give the player a total of 65,275 Attack, 27,537.5 Strength, and 15,300 Defence experience. This would get the player up to level 45 Attack, level 37 Strength, and level 31 Defence without doing any melee training.

Fastest Experience

 Levels 1-30: Questing 
Completing the Waterfall Quest at level 1 Attack and Strength will instantly bring the player to level 30 in strength and attack.  This quest has no requirements, making it the fastest way to train a brand-new account to these levels, skipping much of the slow low-level training. However, there are several aggressive and hard-hitting monsters during the quest, so players may alternatively want to train some Defence and Hitpoints levels to make the quest safer. Completing the Recommended quests will get the player up to level 45 Attack, level 37 Strength, and level 31 Defence.

Levels 30 to 50: Crabs

Levels 50-70: Nightmare Zone - Normal Rumble

Levels 70-99:  Nightmare Zone
Since Dharok's potential is dependent on having high max , it becomes optimal at . Otherwise, the combination of Obsidian Armour, a Berserker Necklace, and the Toktz-Xil-Ak is optimal. 

Other methods
You may use these if the above methods are too crowded or otherwise not available. However, they are not as good as the other methods.

It is not recommended to train melee for profit at low levels. It is usually better to train with crabs, Slayer, or the Nightmare Zone and do something else to make money for overall more efficient play. For example, killing Hobgoblins for two hours will give both less money and less experience than spinning flax for one hour and training on crabs for one hour. Low-level players looking to make money for early gear should check out the Money-making guide.

Here are some easy options for training melee if you do want to kill monsters for profit and still get decent experience rates.
Levels 1 to 10: Chickens

Levels 10 to 60: Rock Crabs

Levels 30 to 60: Chaos druids

 Levels 30 to 81: Ogres 

Levels 40 to 60: Moss giants

Equipment choice
Items will be listed in order of how much they increase general melee damage per second. In nearly all cases, optimising for offensive stats is more effective than optimising for defensive or balanced stats, especially when fighting the low-offence, high-hp monsters on this list. In addition, optimising for Strength is usually better than optimising for accuracy except against high-Defence monsters.
Head-slot items in order of effectiveness

 Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
 Three of these items provide the same Strength bonus of +3, so choose between them based on their other stats such as their Defence or availability. Note that these Strength-boosting helmets are almost always better than helmets that only provide accuracy, such as the warrior helm, for general training.
 When training Slayer, a Slayer helm (or black mask) will always provide the greatest damage increase over any of these.

Cape-slot items in order of effectiveness

If the player does not have access to any of these, an obsidian cape or a Cape of Accomplishment can be used instead due to their moderate Defence bonuses, however, they will not increase damage. The Ardougne cloak also provides a stab accuracy bonus and a moderate Prayer bonus.

Neck-slot items in order of effectiveness

Depending on your stats, for monsters with low Defence, an amulet of Strength can be better than an amulet of power, amulet of glory, or even an amulet of fury.
When fighting undead monsters and not using a Slayer helmet, the salve amulet and its upgraded version the salve amulet (e) are the best neck-slot items.

Body-slot items in order of effectiveness

Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
Five of these items provide the same Strength bonus, but the Oathplate chest and Bandos chestplate have much better defence.

Shield-slot items in order of effectiveness

When fighting dragons, a Dragonfire shield is the best melee offhand item due to its ability to block dragonfire while having high Strength and Defence bonuses. IMPORTANT: The "Uncharged" Dragonfire shield has about 1/3 the defensive characteristics of the charged shield. If the dragonfire protection and high Defence are not needed, defenders are better due to their accuracy bonuses.

As defenders require access to the Warriors' Guild and thus a combined Attack and Strength level of 130 (for example, level 65 in both), the Toktz-ket-xil or dragonfire shield should be used until that requirement is met. If the required Defence levels for those items (60 and 75 respectively) aren't met, a book of war can be used.

Legs-slot items in order of effectiveness

Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
Items shown without strength bonus are included to show defensive stats and give less expensive options.

Hands-slot items in order of effectiveness

Feet-slot items in order of effectiveness

Ring-slot items in order of effectiveness

Rings should be imbued as soon as possible. Also note that the Warrior, Tyrannical, and Treasonous rings only benefit one attacking style each, while the Brimstone ring benefits all melee combat. If the player cannot afford any of these rings, a ring of wealth is a decent alternative to help improve rare drop table rolls and pick up coins, but it does not increase damage. Low level players can benefit from a ring of recoil, as 10% + 1 of the damage received by the player (rounded down) is dealt to the attacker, and always recoils at least 1 damage when the player is hit.

Weapon choice
Choosing a weapon

In most cases, choosing a weapon with an attack speed of 2.4 seconds (4 ticks) will be the best choice for dealing the highest damage per second. Slower weapons almost always give less experience overall against low-defence monsters, even if they do more damage per hit, but may deal more against high-defence monsters.
Monster vulnerability may cause certain weapons to perform better than their stats suggest. For example, most dragons are weak to Stab, making the otherwise weaker zamorakian hasta a better choice than the abyssal whip when fighting them. Check a monster's wiki page to see its defensive bonuses and consider picking a weapon it is weak to.

Training weapons in order of effectiveness
Note: All one-handed weapons in this table will have their stats displayed as if they were paired with an avernic defender to make a fair comparison to two-handed weapons.
Note: Some Crush weapons in this table will have stats displayed as paired with the inquisitor's armour set and its respective defender, if applicable, to more easily showcase the enhancements the set effect offers to weapons that deliver Crush attacks.

If you do not have access to a shield at all, such as if you do not want to risk an additional item in the Wilderness or you have not yet unlocked the requirements for certain offhand equipment, some fast two-handed weapons like the Saradomin sword become worth using.

The weapons listed here with level requirements of less than 70 Attack will include the dragon defender bonuses instead of the Avernic one, while weapons with a requirement of less than 60 will not include the bonuses of a defender, as it is unlikely that someone using one of these low level weapons would have access to one due to the 130 Attack+Strength requirement. As noted above, players with 60 Defence without access to defenders should be using the Toktz-ket-xil.

Its Strength bonus is tied with the inquisitor's mace and the blade of Saeldor. It does not degrade and it primarily uses the Stab attack style. It is worth mentioning the player can attack with the Ghrazi Rapier every 2.4 seconds as opposed to the slightly slower attack rate of Osmumten's fang (every 3.0 seconds).80 AttackCrushAll Stats +123 Crush+97 StrengthThis is one of the best melee training weapons. Its Strength bonus is tied with the ghrazi rapier and the blade of Saeldor. It does not degrade and it primarily uses the Crush attack style.
When combined with the inquisitor's armour, the weapon's enhanced Strength bonus and significantly improved accuracy become devastating against enemies with high Defence. The four-tick weapon speed and the capability to train all melee stats render it one of the best melee weapons available.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +155 Crush+107 Strength80 AttackSlashAll Stats +123 Slash+97 StrengthThis is one of the best melee training weapons. Its Strength bonus is tied with the ghrazi rapier and the inquisitor's mace. However, it must be charged with crystal shards, which can be obtained from either doing various activities around Prifddinas or from exchanging certain crystal seeds with Amrod. This effectively makes the sword require Song of the Elves to use. Each shard grants 100 charges; the weapon can store up to 20,000 charges and loses one charge with each hit (regardless of whether the hit is successful or not). One can bring it and 1,000 crystal shards to a singing bowl to make blade of Saeldor (c), which is non-degradable and non-tradeable (requires level 82 Crafting and Smithing).75 AttackSlashAll stats +109 Slash+88 StrengthThis is the best non-degradable weapon for training Strength at level 75.

The whip is the second-strongest non-degradable Attack and Defence training weapon in the game. Using this weapon on Controlled is an easy, but slower way to reach 99 Attack, Strength, and Defence since all the experience is spread across these three skills. One disadvantage of the abyssal whip is that it cannot train Strength without training Attack and Defence at the same time, so pures should avoid using it to train.75 AttackSlashStrength +100 Slash+88 StrengthSimilar to the abyssal tentacle, this weapon degrades.

If you can afford to combine this weapon with the inquisitor's armour set, the significantly improved accuracy and slightly improved damage make this weapon even more powerful.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +135 Crush+95 Strength70 AttackBarbarian TrainingStabDefenceAll stats on Controlled +115 Stab+83 StrengthThis weapon is not generally chosen for everyday training due to only being able to train on controlled or defensive. It is both weaker and more expensive than the abyssal whip. It is primarily used against monsters with a weakness to Stab, such as all types of dragons. It also has a decent Crush bonus, so it can be used as an alternative to the Abyssal bludgeon for fighting Crush-weak enemies like Kalphites and Vet'ion.70 AttackStabStrength +105 Stab+83 StrengthThe fourth-best one-handed Strength training weapon. It should not be used for Attack training unless a Stab weapon is needed.75 Attack75 MagicSlashStrength +99 Slash+80 StrengthThe fifth-best one-handed Strength training weapon. It is more accurate with a defender than the next-best Strength training weapon, the Saradomin sword, but has lower Strength. This makes the staff better against high-defence monsters, but it is much less affordable. Also, it is strictly worse than the abyssal dagger, which should usually be used instead unless a slash weapon is needed.70 AttackSlashStrength +82 Slash+82 StrengthThe Saradomin sword is a much more affordable Strength training weapon than anything above it on this list. Against lower-defence monsters such as Yaks, the Saradomin sword will on average do higher damage per second than the staff of the dead due to its higher Strength. However, this sword's lack of a shield and the staff's magic capabilities and melee accuracy make the staff usually more desirable if you can afford it.Attack & Strength Bonus (with Dragon Defender, if applicable)65 AttackSlashAll Stats +129 Slash+113 StrengthThe zombie axe has a 5-tick weapon speed and does slightly less DPS than the abyssal whip against enemies with low Defence; however, it has a higher potential DPS against enemies with high Defence or that are weak to Crush. 
The inquisitor's armour set makes the Crush style attack of the zombie axe slightly more powerful and extremely accurate.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +145 Crush+123 Strength65 AttackCrushStrength +93 Crush+76 StrengthThe Sarachnis cudgel is generally not favoured for training due to its marginal advantages over the dragon scimitar and its requirement of 5 additional Attack levels to wield. Compared to higher-tier weapons requiring 70+ Attack, like the Saradomin sword and staff of the dead, it falls short in melee Strength. Nonetheless, the cudgel may have the upper hand in rare situations where the target is susceptible to Crush attacks.
The inquisitor's armour set enhances the Crush Style attacks of the Sarachnis cudgel, increasing both power and accuracy.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +125 Crush+86 Strength60 AttackCrushStrength +91 Crush+72 StrengthThis weapon is on par with the dragon scimitar as the best training weapon for all attack styles at level 60 Attack, requiring no charging or quest completion. When charged with revenant ether, it grants a 50% boost in melee accuracy and damage against NPCs in the Wilderness, often surpassing other weapons in training speed if used there. However, it is notably more expensive than the dragon scimitar and carries the risk of losing money through charges if the user is killed in the Wilderness. Moreover, when used with any of the defenders, the mace's accuracy is slightly inferior to that of the dragon scimitar, as defenders tend to offer greater offensive bonuses for Stab/Slash than for Crush.
The inquisitor's armour set significantly enhances the accuracy and damage of Viggora's chainmace by providing a buff to its base Crush and Strength bonus. This amplifies the chainmace's passive 50% boost in accuracy and damage against Wilderness NPCs, particularly when combined with either the salve amulet or the Slayer helmet. This is not advised though as this would be a significant risk.Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +122 Crush+82 Strength60 AttackMonkey Madness ISlashAll Stats +91 Slash+72 StrengthThis is tied for the best training weapon for all attack styles at level 60 with the Viggora's chainmace. In addition, the dragon scimitar is a much cheaper alternative to all of the weapons listed above, making it very popular even among some high level players. For Attack and Defence training, it should be replaced with the abyssal whip as soon as one can afford and equip it.60 AttackStabAll Stats +90 Stab+69 StrengthThis is comparable to the dragon scimitar in stats, but without the quest requirement of Monkey Madness I.65 Attack55 SlayerCrushStrength +96 Slash+95 Crush+98 StrengthThis 5-tick weapon holds the third-highest Strength bonus for single-handed weapons. It is particularly effective against creatures susceptible to Crush damage and is only outperformed by the zombie axe within its level category.

Wearing Inquisitor's Armour +127 Crush+108 Strength60 AttackLost CitySlashAll Stats +93 Slash+77 StrengthA viable alternate training weapon before being able to use the dragon scimitar since Monkey Madness I is a much longer and harder quest than Lost City.

Other equipment options
Obsidian equipment + Berserker necklace
Wearing the obsidian platebody, obsidian platelegs, and the obsidian helmet gives a 10% damage and accuracy bonus to melee obsidian weapons. Wearing the berserker necklace also gives another 20% damage bonus to Obsidian weapons. Combining all four of these items with the Toktz-xil-ak (Obsidian sword) can give faster experience rates than anything in the table above against low-defence monsters, such as those in the Nightmare Zone. However, the set has below-average Defence and does not allow the use of a Slayer helmet. If the player cannot use all five items, they should not be using the Toktz-xil-ak.
Void knight equipment
Wearing the Void melee helm with the full Void Knight equipment set gives a 10% melee damage and accuracy bonus. This bonus accuracy makes it good against certain high-defence monsters like the Corporeal Beast. It is a good alternative for players with 42 combat stats who do not have access to high-Strength gear. However, this set gives less Strength than other melee equipment and has significantly lower melee and ranged Defence, making it usually worse for training than high-strength gear.
Dharok the Wretched's equipment
Wearing a full set of Dharok the Wretched's equipment gives the set effect of increasing the player's damage the lower their remaining Hitpoints are. Using a dwarven rock cake or locator orb the player can intentionally keep their health at 1 hp while using protection prayers to block all forms of damage. If the player has a source of Prayer or damage block, such as by using Prayer potions, absorptions (Nightmare Zone only), or an altar, the player can safely use the set's effect to deal very high amounts of damage and gain fast experience. However, the set degrades after 15 hours of use and must be repaired to keep its stats.
Guthan the Infested's equipment
Wearing a full set of Guthan the Infested's equipment gives the set effect of a 25% chance to heal the player by the damage dealt. This set deals less damage than some of the best options on the list, but it allows players to train for long periods without banking to heal. Players can bring the four pieces in their inventory, train on their normal high-strength equipment, and switch to the Guthan's equipment only when their health gets low. Popular monsters for this tactic are gargoyles, nechryael, and bandits. However, the set degrades after 15 hours of use and must be repaired to keep its stats.

===== Free-to-play melee training =====
This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints through melee combat in free-to-play.

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level, but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food, or use food that heals more.

Equipment choice
Players should always use the best scimitar they can equip as scimitars offer the highest damage per second of any other type of free-to-play melee weapon due to their high speed and high strength bonus. Use the amulet of strength if it gives a higher max hit for your Strength level, otherwise use the amulet of power for more accuracy, defence, and especially if it provides the same maximum damage as the amulet of strength at certain Strength levels with certain attack styles. Use full melee armour sets against monsters that use melee, and ranged armour against monsters that use magic. A chainbody is more useful than a platebody against monsters that use crush.

As for boots, you may start off with fancy boots or fighting boots (both have same stats as members' bronze boots) that are awarded in the Stronghold of Security, or leather boots if you don't want to reclaim the stronghold boots when you die. The best-in-slot boots for melee combat is decorative boots (gold) for its melee defence and its +1 Strength bonus (same stats as members' adamant boots). However, the time it takes to obtain gold decorative boots (400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time spent to train melee skills to 99 but if you quickly want more defence bonus over fancy or fighting boots to tank more hits, decorative boots (red) (same stats as members' steel boots) is a decent defence upgrade with +4 more defence bonus than fancy/fighting boots that can easily be obtained within a few Castle Wars matches (4 castle wars tickets) and with a bit more time put into Castle Wars, decorative boots (white) (same stats as members' mithril boots, 40 castle wars tickets) is a good defence upgrade with +3 more defence bonuses than red boots if you don't wish to spend a lot of time going for decorative boots (gold) for the gold boots' +1 Strength Bonus.

As for capes, all coloured capes, team capes, and the cabbage cape share the same defence bonus and are best-in-slot for free-to-play players. For gloves, gilded d'hide vambraces are best-in-slot but require 40 Ranged to equip and may be prohibitively expensive for some players. A cheaper alternative is green d'hide vambraces, otherwise the next best choice is leather vambraces or leather/coloured gloves depending on enemy attack style until 40 Ranged is achieved.

Maximum hit

Rune scimitars offer the best damage per second (DPS) in free-to-play and is recommended to use for melee training from Level 40 Attack and all melee skill onwards so it is recommended to achieve Level 40 Attack as soon as possible. Training Attack slightly increases the attack accuracy of your hits. However, training Strength is important for increasing maximum damage which also increases damage per second.

To further increase damage per second, there are three free-to-play neck slot items that can provide attack and/or strength bonuses including amulet of accuracy, amulet of power, and amulet of strength. If the player cannot afford an amulet of power or if an ironman cannot acquire an amulet of strength ( to craft a ruby amulet and  for Lvl-3 Enchant) or an amulet of power ( to craft a diamond amulet and  for Lvl-4 Enchant), the amulet of accuracy from Imp Catcher is a weaker alternative to the amulet of power (without a strength bonus) until the player can acquire one of the other two amulets.

The skill to train first depends on the player's preference and a preferential example could be to keep melee skills (and Defence) within five or ten levels of each other while prioritising one combat skill over the others. If the player wants to deal the most damage first, the player would prioritise training Strength until they achieve a new maximum hit for a different attack style to train the next combat skill with the amulet of power.

Strength levels 1 to 99
The following tables below will determine the maximum of damage certain weapons can inflict on enemies at certain attack styles with the following amulets at certain Strength levels so that you can determine which enchanted amulet you should use at certain Strength levels. The aggressive attack style adds an invisible +3 Strength level boost, the amulet of power adds a +6 Melee Strength bonus, and the amulet of strength adds a +10 Melee Strength bonus. Amulet of accuracy is not included in the table since it does not provide a strength bonus, and even though gold decorative boots from Castle Wars provide a Melee Strength bonus of +1 with higher defence bonuses than fighting boots/fancy boots, the amount of time it takes to acquire the boots (over 40 hours if winning Castle Wars every time to 400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time to train Attack, Strength, and Defence to 99 and so the tables will not account for gold decorative boots' bonus.

Strength levels higher than 99 are strength boosts from the use of beer or strength potion. At level 99 Strength, a strength potion will temporarily boost strength up to 111.

Barronite mace
Free-to-play ironmen can only acquire a rune scimitar through smithing at level 90 Smithing (or level 89 Smithing with a dwarven stout). Until then, the second best option for free-to-play ironmen to effectively train melee combat is barronite mace, which can be obtained by exchanging a barronite guard, barronite handle, barronite head, and 1,500 barronite shards to Ramarno in the Ruins of Camdozaal after the completion of Below Ice Mountain.

Rune sword
The third best option would be the rune sword, or alternatively the rune mace at certain Strength levels depending on which amulet you use, both of which can be bought from the Champions' Guild. While rune longswords are stronger and more accurate than rune swords and rune maces, it is slower, resulting in a lower damage per second. Rune swords provide the third best melee damage per second in free-to-play and are good for ironmen to train with until a barronite mace or rune scimitar is obtained.

Alternative accounts in Clan Wars
If you have a 1 Defence combat pure and high Hitpoints (80+ HP for example), stock them up with jugs of wine and attack them in the Free-For-All Clan Wars portal. This is the fastest combat training method in free-to-play when done efficiently. This training method is not recommended for players who have not yet made a one-Defence combat pure account and it wouldn't be worth the time training one up just for this training method alone. But it is recommended for alternate accounts created after a high HP one-Defence combat pure account.

Alternatively, wizard's mind bombs can reduce a character's Defence towards 0 Defence but Defence will regenerate by a point every 60 seconds.

Alternative accounts in Castle Wars
Thanks to the castle wars bracelet and castlewars brew, the Castle Wars minigame provides considerable combat bonuses in comparison to the Clan Wars minigame. By attacking a 1 Defence combat pure holding a captured flag, you can achieve the highest maximum melee hits in free-to-play worlds. The alternative account can be healed with bandages without the need to bring any supplies. To make the healing more effective, wear a castle wars bracelet. Note that the healing scales with the Hitpoints level, so to maximise the effect the account needs at least 90 level.

===== Free-to-play melee training =====
This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints through melee combat in free-to-play.

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level, but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food, or use food that heals more.

Equipment choice
Players should always use the best scimitar they can equip as scimitars offer the highest damage per second of any other type of free-to-play melee weapon due to their high speed and high strength bonus. Use the amulet of strength if it gives a higher max hit for your Strength level, otherwise use the amulet of power for more accuracy, defence, and especially if it provides the same maximum damage as the amulet of strength at certain Strength levels with certain attack styles. Use full melee armour sets against monsters that use melee, and ranged armour against monsters that use magic. A chainbody is more useful than a platebody against monsters that use crush.

As for boots, you may start off with fancy boots or fighting boots (both have same stats as members' bronze boots) that are awarded in the Stronghold of Security, or leather boots if you don't want to reclaim the stronghold boots when you die. The best-in-slot boots for melee combat is decorative boots (gold) for its melee defence and its +1 Strength bonus (same stats as members' adamant boots). However, the time it takes to obtain gold decorative boots (400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time spent to train melee skills to 99 but if you quickly want more defence bonus over fancy or fighting boots to tank more hits, decorative boots (red) (same stats as members' steel boots) is a decent defence upgrade with +4 more defence bonus than fancy/fighting boots that can easily be obtained within a few Castle Wars matches (4 castle wars tickets) and with a bit more time put into Castle Wars, decorative boots (white) (same stats as members' mithril boots, 40 castle wars tickets) is a good defence upgrade with +3 more defence bonuses than red boots if you don't wish to spend a lot of time going for decorative boots (gold) for the gold boots' +1 Strength Bonus.

As for capes, all coloured capes, team capes, and the cabbage cape share the same defence bonus and are best-in-slot for free-to-play players. For gloves, gilded d'hide vambraces are best-in-slot but require 40 Ranged to equip and may be prohibitively expensive for some players. A cheaper alternative is green d'hide vambraces, otherwise the next best choice is leather vambraces or leather/coloured gloves depending on enemy attack style until 40 Ranged is achieved.

Maximum hit

Rune scimitars offer the best damage per second (DPS) in free-to-play and is recommended to use for melee training from Level 40 Attack and all melee skill onwards so it is recommended to achieve Level 40 Attack as soon as possible. Training Attack slightly increases the attack accuracy of your hits. However, training Strength is important for increasing maximum damage which also increases damage per second.

To further increase damage per second, there are three free-to-play neck slot items that can provide attack and/or strength bonuses including amulet of accuracy, amulet of power, and amulet of strength. If the player cannot afford an amulet of power or if an ironman cannot acquire an amulet of strength ( to craft a ruby amulet and  for Lvl-3 Enchant) or an amulet of power ( to craft a diamond amulet and  for Lvl-4 Enchant), the amulet of accuracy from Imp Catcher is a weaker alternative to the amulet of power (without a strength bonus) until the player can acquire one of the other two amulets.

The skill to train first depends on the player's preference and a preferential example could be to keep melee skills (and Defence) within five or ten levels of each other while prioritising one combat skill over the others. If the player wants to deal the most damage first, the player would prioritise training Strength until they achieve a new maximum hit for a different attack style to train the next combat skill with the amulet of power.

The following tables below will determine the maximum of damage certain weapons can inflict on enemies at certain attack styles with the following amulets at certain Strength levels so that you can determine which enchanted amulet you should use at certain Strength levels. The aggressive attack style adds an invisible +3 Strength level boost, the amulet of power adds a +6 Melee Strength bonus, and the amulet of strength adds a +10 Melee Strength bonus. Amulet of accuracy is not included in the table since it does not provide a strength bonus, and even though gold decorative boots from Castle Wars provide a Melee Strength bonus of +1 with higher defence bonuses than fighting boots/fancy boots, the amount of time it takes to acquire the boots (over 40 hours if winning Castle Wars every time to 400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time to train Attack, Strength, and Defence to 99 and so the tables will not account for gold decorative boots' bonus.

Strength levels higher than 99 are strength boosts from the use of beer or strength potion. At level 99 Strength, a strength potion will temporarily boost strength up to 111.

Barronite mace
Free-to-play ironmen can only acquire a rune scimitar through smithing at level 90 Smithing (or level 89 Smithing with a dwarven stout). Until then, the second best option for free-to-play ironmen to effectively train melee combat is barronite mace, which can be obtained by exchanging a barronite guard, barronite handle, barronite head, and 1,500 barronite shards to Ramarno in the Ruins of Camdozaal after the completion of Below Ice Mountain.

Rune sword
The third best option would be the rune sword, or alternatively the rune mace at certain Strength levels depending on which amulet you use, both of which can be bought from the Champions' Guild. While rune longswords are stronger and more accurate than rune swords and rune maces, it is slower, resulting in a lower damage per second. Rune swords provide the third best melee damage per second in free-to-play and are good for ironmen to train with until a barronite mace or rune scimitar is obtained.

The maximum hit table below is for the rune sword.

Alternative accounts in Clan Wars
If you have a 1 Defence combat pure and high Hitpoints (80+ HP for example), stock them up with jugs of wine and attack them in the Free-For-All Clan Wars portal. This is the fastest combat training method in free-to-play when done efficiently. This training method is not recommended for players who have not yet made a one-Defence combat pure account and it wouldn't be worth the time training one up just for this training method alone. But it is recommended for alternate accounts created after a high HP one-Defence combat pure account.

Alternatively, wizard's mind bombs can reduce a character's Defence towards 0 Defence but Defence will regenerate by a point every 60 seconds.

Alternative accounts in Castle Wars
Thanks to the castle wars bracelet and castlewars brew, the Castle Wars minigame provides considerable combat bonuses in comparison to the Clan Wars minigame. By attacking a 1 Defence combat pure holding a captured flag, you can achieve the highest maximum melee hits in free-to-play worlds. The alternative account can be healed with bandages without the need to bring any supplies. To make the healing more effective, wear a castle wars bracelet. Note that the healing scales with the Hitpoints level, so to maximise the effect the account needs at least 90 level.

===== Pay-to-play Ranged training =====
This article provides an overview of strategies used to train the Ranged skill.

General training notes
Using the rapid attack style will offer the highest damage output and the fastest experience rates. For chinchompas, the rapid attack style is called 'Medium fuse'. Longrange should only be used to train Defence while throwing chinchompas. Use the best ranged armour available to maximise damage output.

Ava's devices return a percentage of certain ammunition fired. They are obtained from Ava after completing Animal Magnetism, which requires level 30 Ranged. Wearing one of the devices will save a lot of money and time when using certain Ranged weapons (such as darts or shortbows), as the player does not need as much ammunition or to pick it up as often. Ammunition recovery will not work if wearing a metallic body.

Device  req. Recovery rate Effectiveness The amount of times a given piece of ammunition can be used, on average, before being broken or lost.  30 60% 2.5  50 72% 3.57  Also requires a Vorkath's head, which is obtainable after Dragon Slayer II. 70 80% 5

If picking up ammunition, speak to the Ranged combat tutor to toggle whether or not the ammunition will automatically be equipped.

Void Knight equipment with the Void ranger helm is best against low defence monsters due to its damage-boosting set effect, while crystal armour or Masori armour are much better against higher defence monsters. Getting the void full set is not worthwhile timewise unless training to 99 using the fastest methods possible, however it is useful for Vorkath, low-switch Zulrah, Theatre of Blood, and it is required for an elite Western Provinces Diary task. Completing the hard Western Provinces diary unlocks the elite upgrade for the void knight top and robe for an extra 400 Pest Control points.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–32/36: Questing
alt=Placement of the multicannon for killing ogres|thumb|width=250x250|Castle Wars Ogre multicannon spot
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Ranged experience. Completing Shadow of the Storm (putting the experience reward on Ranged), Death to the Dorgeshuun, and Horror from the Deep grants a total of 16,662.5 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 32. The level 40 Ranged requirement for Temple of Ikov can be bypassed by wielding knives or darts whilst wielding ice arrows, allowing for a further 10,500 experience. This will get the player up to level 36.

Levels 1–45: Using dwarf multicannon

Using the dwarf multicannon offers the fastest experience up to level 45. Players must have completed Dwarf Cannon quest to use the dwarf multicannon, but there are no level requirements to use one. The cannon offers much higher damage output compared to other options at low levels, as it has a max hit of 30 with regular cannonballs regardless of the player's Ranged level. The accuracy of the multicannon is affected by the accuracy of the player's selected attack style, either ranged or melee, taking into account the attack bonus for that particular style. 

Cannoning can be fairly expensive, however. At level 45, chinning becomes a lot faster and is usually a cheaper alternative.

Cannoning with Slayer
Training Slayer grants passive Ranged experience from using the dwarf multicannon. It is always worth using the cannon wherever applicable, as the cost of using the cannon is justified by the saved time compared to not using one. A melee task can take almost twice as long if not using the cannon. For example, in multi-combat areas such as during dagannoth and kalphite tasks the cannon will deal most of the damage, while the player is getting nearly as much Melee experience as they would without using a cannon. Should the player not be able to afford to use the cannon, it is better to make the money for the cannonballs than train Slayer without the cannon.

The amount of Ranged experience gained from Slayer depends on the player's task list. Players can expect to gain around 2–4 million Ranged experience from level 99 Slayer.

Active cannoning methods
Alternatively, kill monsters with the dwarf multicannon to actively train Ranged.

 Ogres east of Castle Wars have no additional quest requirements, and cannoning them offers around 40,000 experience per hour from the cannon alone. They can be crowded, however.
 Ogres in the Combat Training Camp require completing Biohazard, but can be less crowded.
 Cannoning ice trolls north of Jatizso after completing The Fremennik Trials is a slower alternative at higher levels, but the drops cover the cost of the cannonballs. Use the coal rocks west of the eastern mining icon as a safespot. The trolls can deal heavy damage if not safespotted, so consider bringing backup food and runes for Telekinetic Grab for the loot.

Levels 45–99: Chinning maniacal monkeys
thumb|Chinning maniacal monkeys.
For more information, see Maniacal monkey/Strategies.

Throwing chinchompas (commonly known as "chinning") at maniacal monkeys is the fastest way to train Ranged. Maniacal monkeys are located in Kruk's Dungeon on Ape Atoll, which requires having started chapter II of Monkey Madness II to access. While chinning is much faster than any other methods, it also costs money.

For the fastest experience rates, use equipment that maximises Ranged Strength, or Void Knight ranged equipment for its damage buff. This is because the maniacal monkeys have low defence. Void Knight equipment is higher DPSDamage per second. than dragonhide armour due to its damage-boosting set effect; however Masori armour with Zaryte vambraces is better than standard Void Knight equipment In most setups Masori beats Void. That being said, DPS and therefore experience depends on ranged level, prayers used, other equipment used, and other factors. It's best to check your DPS yourself to compare. due to its ranged strength bonus increasing damage per second. Elite Void Knight equipment is best in slot for most players. This is because it often has marginally higher DPS but also the prayer bonus reduces the time needed to collect and drink prayer potions, further increasing experience rates. Though the difference is minimal, and both Void and Masori are excellent choices. If you don't have access to these, use Hueycoatl hide armour or Blessed dragonhide armour. 

Maniacal monkeys drop 1-dose prayer potions which negates the cost of using Protect from Melee and damage-boosting prayers. Players who have completed the hard Morytania Diary can alternatively use a bonecrusher necklace to restore Prayer points.

Experience rates in the table below assume wearing the best damage-boosting equipment available, using Rigour, using two dancing accounts to stack the monkeys, using divine ranging potions, and throwing 1,970 chinchompas per hour. With Eagle Eye, the rates would be roughly 5–7% lower.

Other methods
Levels 1–45/70: Crabs
Killing crabs is an afkable and relatively cheap way of training Ranged at lower levels. Choose a spot that makes two or three spawns aggressive at the same time. Turn on Auto Retaliate, and kill crabs with the best Ranged setup available. After 10 minutes, reset aggressiveness by running away far enough, usually a minimap's length. 

There are five types of crabs the player can train on. They all have high Hitpoints, very low Defence and deal minimal damage.

 Gemstone Crab near Tal Teklan in Varlamore has unlimited Hitpoints and only moves every 9 minutes, thus making it a very afk alternative. Multiple people can attack this crab, removing the risk of getting crashed or having to find an open spot.
Ammonite crabs on Fossil Island have 100 Hitpoints. They also drop unidentified fossils, which can be turned in for experience lamps in Varrock Museum after cleaning. They can be very crowded.
Swamp crabs have 75 Hitpoints and are weak to Ranged. A safe area is located south-west of Port Phasmatys near the Morytania Graveyard, where two crabs can become aggressive in a multi-combat zone.
Sand crabs near Hosidius have 60 Hitpoints and have no quest requirements, but are usually crowded.
Rock crabs near Rellekka have no quest requirements and are usually less crowded than sand and ammonite crabs, but only have 50 Hitpoints.

Having at least level 30 Defence is recommended before starting Ranged training on these monsters to minimise the damage taken. Use a spot with fewer spawns if taking too much damage from too many crabs. If waiting for respawns, use a spot with more spawns or switch to a higher Hitpoints crab. 

Recommended weapons and armour

Darts are the best weapon to use for both damage output and cost. Use the highest-level darts available up to amethyst () or adamant (). Depending on the Grand Exchange prices, the following options can be good alternatives:
Rune knives () are slightly weaker than rune darts (), but can be cheaper. 
Magic shortbow (i) (or yew shortbow below level 50) with rune arrows () offers comparable damage output to adamant darts. Amethyst arrows () can be used with a magic shortbow (i) for extra damage, however they are notably more expensive compared to rune.
Hunters' sunlight crossbow (50 Hunter requirement) with moonlight antler bolts () is a stronger alternative to the magic shortbow (i), offering slightly higher damage output than adamant darts.

Other crossbows are not recommended due to their slower attack speed, which makes them worse in damage output compared to the options above. While using the Dorgeshuun crossbow with bone bolts can be very cheap, even mithril darts offer much higher damage output and they are usually comparable in terms of cost.

Players with level 60 Defence are advised to use an odium ward if using a one-handed weapon (such as darts), as it gives +4 Ranged strength and has no Ranged level requirement. The odium ward currently costs . Players with level 75 Hitpoints can also use the necklace of anguish, however it is much more expensive (currently costing ).

Because crabs have very low Defence, having the highest possible Ranged accuracy bonuses is not too important. It is still recommended to at least upgrade the body and leg slot equipment whenever a better tier becomes available, since they give the most accuracy and defence bonuses of all the slots.

Levels 45–99: Chinning skeletal monkeys
Throwing chinchompas at skeletal monkeys is only recommended for those who cannot access maniacal monkeys. Skeletal monkeys are located in the Ape Atoll Dungeon, which requires partial completion of Monkey Madness I to access.

Being undead monsters, the salve amulet (ei) accuracy and damage boosts apply against them. However, the boosts only affect the primary target. Wearing the salve amulet is still recommended to reduce splashing, as chinchompas will miss all targets if they miss the main target.

Levels 70–99: Pest Control
Participating at the Pest Control minigame and spending Void Knight commendation points on Ranged experience is an alternative training method at higher levels. Having a combat level of at least 100 for the veteran boat is recommended. Completion of the easy, medium and hard Combat Achievements increases the number of points earned per game.

Experience rates in the table below assume 26 games per hour in the veteran boat, gaining 40,000 experience per hour from fighting pests, and spending 100 points at a time for 10% more experience per point.

Levels 70/80–99: Nightmare Zone
For more information, see Nightmare Zone/Strategies.

Using the normal customisable rumble setup in Nightmare Zone allows for 20 minutes of AFK Ranged training. After 20 minutes, the player will stop attacking the monsters and needs to interact with the client to start attacking again. Using the venator bow with super ranging potions and absorptions offers up to 140,000–150,000 (180,000-190,000 on hard mode) experience per hour at level 99. Slower but cheaper alternatives include the imbued magic shortbow with rune or amethyst arrows, or adamant darts with the twisted buckler.

Levels 75/80–99: Training Ranged with Slayer
Using the toxic blowpipe or the venator bow for Slayer training is not considered efficient to do, however it is an option for players who do not value gaining Melee or Magic experience and want some variety to their training. The benefit of ranging Slayer tasks is that it is relatively decent Ranged experience per hour and it also results in slightly higher Slayer experience rates as the blowpipe offers slightly higher damage output compared to most Melee weapons. Training Ranged whilst on a task also enables the player to use a Slayer helmet (i) for a 15% boost to ranged accuracy and damage while also taking advantage of the accuracy bonuses of dragonhide or Armadyl armour. However, using the blowpipe is expensive, although this can be somewhat mitigated by monster drops. Using other weapons is not recommended as they have less damage output than using Melee.

Levels 80–99: Monkeys with Venator bow

As a cheap (albeit slower) alternative to Chinning, the Venator bow can be used with Amethyst arrows to kill either Skeleton monkeys or Maniacal monkeys to get experience rates between 140,000 and 230,000 per hour. Skeleton monkeys have the benefit of being undead, allowing the player to use the Salve amulet(ei) to maximise DPS and therefore increase experience per hour. Maniacal monkeys are often preferred due to their increased numbers as well as their Prayer potion drops which enable long training sessions. Bring a light source and tinderbox to relight it if necessary. This could be the Kandarin headgear or a Bullseye Lantern if you wish for it to be brighter.

Maniacal monkeys are located in Kruk's Dungeon on Ape Atoll, which requires having started chapter II of Monkey Madness II to access. The main benefit of this area is the endless monsters, always allowing for maximum hits with the Venator bow.

For the fastest experience rates, use equipment that maximises Ranged strength, or Void knight ranged equipment for its damage buff. This is because the Skeleton monkeys and Maniacal monkeys have low defence. Full Masori with the Salve amulet(ei) has the potential to reach the highest experience per hour against Skeleton monkeys specifically, however when facing Maniacal monkeys Elite void equipment is generally better than Masori. 

Hypothetical experience rates with ideal gear can top 270,000 experience per hour, however this requires the player to always be attacking three targets with the Venator bow, and always be in combat. To ensure high rates, the player must also use Divine ranging potions and Rigour or Deadeye (Or less preferably, Eagle eye) along with the Salve amulet(ei). A more realistic maximum is 240,000 experience per hour when getting close to 99 ranged. 

The Dwarf multicannon can also be used against Maniacal monkeys, however it is generally not recommended as the player may see a shortage in monkeys and reduction in experience.

Using Dragon arrows increases DPS by very little, and increases the cost massively. For this reason, it isn't worth it. Adamant arrows can provide a much cheaper alternative to Amethyst arrows while still gaining relatively high experience rates.

The venator bow provides a solid, cheap, alternative to chinning. It requires less player involvement and training at Maniacal monkeys can continue indefinitely due to the Prayer potion drops - this lets the player camp at monkeys until they reach 99 ranged.

Equipment choice
Items will be listed in order of how much they increase general ranged damage per second. In nearly all cases, optimising for offensive stats is more effective than optimising for defensive or balanced stats, especially when fighting low-offence, high hp monsters. In addition, optimising for ranged strength is usually better than optimising for accuracy except against high-defence monsters.

Note: This doesn't include elite void knight equipment or void knight equipment which in many cases can be best-in-slot for training, providing the player uses the set. It also doesn't include the salve amulet(ei) or the slayer helmet (i) which can both be best-in-slot in specific use cases. The Wiki's DPS calculator can be used to determine which gear provides the highest DPS for a specific monster.

Rings should be imbued as soon as possible using the Nightmare Zone, Soul Wars, or with a scroll of imbuing from the Emir's Arena . If the player cannot afford the archers ring, a ring of wealth is a decent alternative to help improve rare drop table rolls and pick up coins, but it does not increase damage.

===== Free-to-play Ranged training =====
Ranged in the free-to-play worlds, while having less equipment and features than in member's worlds, provides some fun with the ability to battle monsters and players who would otherwise be out of reach.

This guide will provide advice for the equipment, attack style, and training locations to use to maximise Ranged experience gained in free-to-play.

Equipment choice
Best-in-slot gear table

Ammunition slot
The below chart for prices should be consulted before purchasing large quantities of arrows. Note that moving up from one tier of arrows to the next will increase max hit by 0-2 damage each. For example, at level 40 Ranged with the rapid attack style, when moving from iron arrows to steel or mithril arrows your max hit will stay at 6 damage and therefore all three will function identically; however, when moving from mithril to adamant, your max hit will increase by 1 to a total of 7 damage, increasing your rate of experience per hour by 16.6%. If you decide to pick up ammo, enable Ammo-picking behaviour in the Gameplay settings in order to automatically equip ammo you pick up if it is already equipped in your ammo slot.

Attack styles
Accurate

The accurate style of attack gives an invisible +3 Ranged level boost, increasing accuracy and, at certain combinations of Ranged level and arrow type, increasing your max hit by 1.

Rapid

The rapid attack style increases your attack speed by 1 tick (attacks come out 0.6 seconds faster).

Longrange

The longrange attack style gives an invisible +3 Defence level boost and increases your attack range by 2 squares (up to 10). All normal Ranged experience that would be gained is split 50/50 between Ranged and Defence.

Which to use
Until your max hit with the rapid attack style is 2, the accurate style is better than rapid when the +3 Ranged bonus increases your max hit with the arrows you are using. However, this is only the case at levels 3-5 (bronze arrows) or 2-4 (iron arrows or bronze bolts). After level 5, rapid becomes better damage per second than accurate for all levels beyond, as +1 max hit damage becomes less and less good in terms of the percentage of damage it contributes to your damage per second compared to the flat 33.3% percent increase from using rapid.

It is not recommended to use longrange for training, since money is spent on arrows when training Defence through Ranged; it's usually cheaper (as well as faster) to train Defence through melee combat instead.

Maximum hit
The maximum hit for free-to-play Ranged is dependent on three factors: Ranged level, arrow type, and whether or not ranged prayer bonus is activated. Note that any other equipment such as bow quality has no direct effect on max hit, it just allows you to use better arrows (though better bows do increase accuracy and therefore damage per second). When there is overlap in maximum hit between the various arrows, it is best to use the cheapest one. For example, at Ranged level 24 a bronze arrow is identical to a mithril arrow in terms of damage output, therefore it is recommended to train using the cheaper bronze arrow. Your maximum hit may also increase due to your shooting style. The accurate style grants +3 to your Ranged level, the rapid style grants +0, and the long range style also grants +0.

Monsters for training
Beginner-level monsters
Seagulls, cows, goblins, and chickens (combat levels vary)
From Ranged levels 1–20, seagulls, cows, goblins, and chickens provide the best possible experience with their extremely low Defence level of 1 and negative Ranged Defence stats. The highest experience rates are achieved at, in order, level 3 seagulls, level 2 seagulls, cows, level 2 goblins, and chickens. Level 3 seagulls are the fastest experience because of their -42 Ranged Defence and large pool of 10 Hitpoints, and will almost never do damage to the player; they can be found either at Port Sarim or at Corsair Cove. Level 2 seagulls have the same low Defence stats, but only have 6 Hitpoints instead of 10. The other monsters, cows, goblins, and chickens, can all be found in the area to the east and north of Lumbridge Castle. Cows can be safespotted across the fences enclosing them, making them also completely safe to train against.

Monks (combat level 5)
Monks are a good alternative to the above monsters as they have slightly higher Defence, but also have 15 hitpoints, do almost no damage, and heal you for free when you talk to them. Monks are slightly slower experience than barbarians but safer to train at. You can find them in the Edgeville Monastery (north-west of Barbarian Village). Even at higher levels, this is still a good place to train. The only cons are that many people train here and it's hard to find a non-crowded world.

Low-level monsters
Barbarians (combat levels 10, 15, and 17)
From Ranged levels 21–25 Barbarians at Barbarian Village are a good inbetween monster for seagulls and giant frogs, as the level 10 barbarians have a slightly lower Hitpoints level of 18 compared to giant frogs' 23 but also have a lower Defence of 3. Since they have the same Defence as monks but higher Hitpoints, they are faster experience than monks, however they are also slightly more dangerous and will not heal you for free.  You are able to safespot these Barbarians with the rocks and torch near the western exit of the village. There are also level 15 and 17 barbarians and a unique barbarian named Gunthor the brave in the long hall at the northern end of the village along with a food spawn on the table. These barbarians can be safespot over the table, however they have higher Defence and are therefore not as good experience as giant frogs, especially Gunthor who has similar Defence to a moss giant. Note that there is a fishing spot near the Barbarian village - many people will drop their Salmon & Trout from there, which you can cook for food.

Giant frogs (combat level 13)
From Ranged levels 26–56, giant frogs are the fastest experience, with their high 23 Hitpoints and low 6 Defence. They can be found in the Lumbridge Swamp, just south of Lumbridge Castle. They only drop big bones, which can be buried for Prayer experience. Banking the bones is not recommended as wizards provide better income.

Optionally, players can bring any axe and a tinderbox to kill nearby Giant Rats for their meat, which can then be cooked by cutting down nearby dead trees.

Wizards (combat level 9) or dark wizards (combat levels 7 or 20)
For players with 20+ Ranged, the two dark wizards in Draynor Village, found among the willow trees near the bank, provide good Ranged training as their magic is often blocked by studded armour. Nearby is the Wizards' Tower, which is home to many level 9 wizards, who give the best combination of loot and experience for Ranged levels between 9 and 69 (inclusive). 

Players with a combat level of 41+ and 30 Ranged can start fighting wizards at Delrith's circle south of Varrock as they drop even more runes (along with being one of the highest likelihood sources for beginner clue scrolls) and are in greater number giving less likelihood of training overcrowding from other players.

Wizards drop copious amounts of runes which can be sold to other players or magic shops or can be later used for Magic training. They are noted for their higher level rune drops, such as nature runes.

Players are, however, advised to have a good supply of food against wizards as the level 7 ones can have a maximum hit of 4 and the level 20 dark wizards can hit up to 6, and frequently do.

One of the main advantages of training Ranged on wizards is that because they use a magic attack they stay where they are to attack. This means that when a player collects their arrows they will be all in the same spot. Melee targets will try to get as close as possible and will move, causing arrows to be scattered.

Minotaurs (combat levels 12 or 27)
Minotaurs found in the Stronghold of Security have a much higher Defence level than giant frogs and have less hitpoints, making them a poor place to train. The primary benefit of training on minotaurs is that they commonly drop iron arrows, allowing for cheap training for players who cannot afford to buy large amounts of arrows for themselves.

Mid-level monsters
Moss giants (combat level 42)
From Ranged levels 57–99, moss giants provide the highest possible experience. They have higher defences than giant frogs and Flesh Crawlers, but also have 60 Hitpoints, one of the largest health pools in free-to-play. However, after around level 57 Ranged you will almost never miss, allowing you to take full advantage of their large pool of health to achieve the highest possible experience rates. Moss giants also have decent drops, most notably big bones and the unique mossy key which is used to access Bryophyta and open Bryophyta's chest.

In free-to-play, they can be found in the innermost part of the Varrock Sewers, Crandor, and the Wilderness. In the Varrock Sewers, there are two separate groups of giants at the end of the sewer, both of which are safespottable. On Crandor there are several which spawn on the south side of the island which can also be safespotted. It may be advisable to train on Crandor mainly due to the fact that there are more spawns. Both locations tend to be crowded from melee and ranged training, but Crandor is a single-way combat area. This means another player cannot deal more damage than you on that monster and therefore steal your drop. The Wilderness is a good place to kill moss giants only for players wishing to collect mossy keys, as the moss giants there have an increased chance of dropping keys but have no safespots.

Rangers new to training on moss giants are advised to train in Varrock Sewers, bringing a slash weapon or knife required to slash the web to get in, a set of runes to cast Varrock Teleport to quickly escape, and the rest of the inventory filled with cheap food such as jugs of wine. Since the area is multicombat, for the first 10 minutes it is easy for players with a low Defence level to take a lot of damage quickly before the moss giants become tolerant, especially when collecting drops, which is why at least some food is recommended.

Observed experience rates at ranged level 72 is around 35,000-37,000 xp per hour, using optimal equipment with adamant arrows and not collecting drops or arrows.

Flesh Crawlers (combat levels 28, 35 or 41)
Flesh Crawlers in the Stronghold of Security have similar defensive stats and give similar experience rates to giant frogs, but are aggressive to players of any level, allowing for afk training for 10 minute periods at a time before they become tolerant. When the Flesh Crawlers are no longer aggressive, players can run a short distance away and back which will reset their aggression for another 10 minutes.

As Flesh Crawlers can quickly and repeatedly hit 1s, it's best to start training against them with around 40–60+ Defence. For food, you can either bring jugs of wine from the bank, teleporting to Barbarian Village with a charged skull sceptre (i) and back to the bank with runes when you run out, or you can bring feathers and a fly fishing rod and catch and cook trout and salmon for food just outside Barbarian Village. As an additional bonus, Flesh Crawlers also drop uncut gems and bottom of sceptres, the latter of which can be chiseled into stackable bone fragments () to sell on the Grand Exchange.

If afk training here on a world that already has at least one player, standing on the same tile as the player(s) that are currently training reduces the chances of the Flesh Crawlers bunching up in a way which causes them to be unable to attack the player, vastly increasing xp rates.

Giant spiders (combat level 50)
Also in the Stronghold of Security, level 50 giant spiders act as an aggressive, afk alternative to moss giants, with very similar Defence but only 50 Hitpoints instead of 60, providing a bit slower experience rates. If players want to train here in Ranged gear and achieve good experience rates, a Defence level of 80 or higher is recommended along with good food such as jugs of wine, as giant spiders are dangerous and can hit up to 7 fairly accurately, especially against Ranged gear. Giant spiders stop being aggressive after 10 minutes; this can be reset by running a short distance away and coming back. Giant spiders have no drops.

Hill giants (combat level 28)
Hill giants have similar Defence to moss giants but have almost half the Hit points, making them slower experience. However, hill giants have better drops than moss giants, both drop big bones () but hill giants also additionally drop limpwurt roots (), nature runes (), and body talismans (). Hill giants are also desirable for their unique giant key drop, which is the only way to access Obor. They can be fought in the Edgeville Dungeon near the Grand Exchange with a safespot, the Giants' Plateau near Al Kharid with a safespot, or in the Wilderness at two different locations, with no safespots. The Wilderness hill giants are risky and are only recommended for players who want to acquire giant keys more quickly, since they drop them more frequently; however, since there are only a few hill giants at both spots in the Wilderness, without world hopping it's faster for keys and experience to simply kill the ones in the Edgeville Dungeon or Giants' Plateau instead.

High-level monsters
Ogresses (combat level 82)
Ogresses are slower than ankou and lesser demons when it comes to Ranged training due to their higher defences but they profit better when being fought at high-level Ranged. They are commonly trained on for profit by high-level free players.

Ogress Warriors and Ogress Shamans can be fought and safespotted in various locations at the Corsair Cove Dungeon by travelling to Corsair Cove by Cabin Boy Colin, found on the piers to the west of Rimmington. Ogress Warriors and Ogress Shamans have a combat level of 82 with 82 hitpoints. They are recommended to be fought with Ranged of 60 to maintain profit but 50 Ranged is doable but slow to kill. For Ranged levels 70–99, they provide the optimal combination of drops and experience. Accurate attack style may be more effective than Rapid due to the ogresses' high ranged defence. While they are tougher enemies to kill, Ogress Shamans have less ranged defence than Ogress Warriors, which makes Ogress Shamans a better option to train on for mid-level and high-level Ranged users. Due to the low range of Ogress Shamans' magical attacks, Ogress Shamans can be safespotted with a shortbow with the attack style set to Accurate or Rapid while still being out of the Ogress Shaman's magical attack range. Even though Ranged XP gained per hour will be slightly lower than ankou and lesser demons due to the Defence of ogresses, ogresses drop valuable items at an uncommon rate such as rune med helms (), rune full helms () and rune battleaxes () that can be high level alchemised by players with 55+ level magic.

Before training and profiting on ogresses, it is recommended to:
Bring hundreds or thousands of adamant arrows if the player can afford a massive amount of these for faster damage per second and experience. For better profit and relaxation while fighting, bring mithril arrows as they are often cheaper than adamant or steel. High-level ranged players should often gain a profit from the amount of arrows they will use against ogresses, even with the more expensive arrows. Ogresses also drop arrows that range from iron to mithril, which could also be used as substitute should the player run out of their primary arrows or save their strongest arrows.
55 or higher Magic: Bring nature runes and a staff of fire (optional as ogresses can drop fire runes and nature runes) to high level alchemise rune drops and mithril kiteshields ().
Optional: Bring a chisel to cut gems for passive Crafting experience, or if you plan on casting high level alchemy on the gems (sapphires are recommended to be dropped after being cut due to their low high level alchemy value).
Optional: Runes for Falador Teleport and travel down to Rimmington.
Bring few pieces of food if needed as ogresses can deal up to 8 hitpoints of damage. Ogresses stop becoming aggressive in a short area after staying in the area for 10 minutes. Alternatively, loaves of bread spawn in certain areas of the Corsair Cove Dungeon.

Lesser demons (combat level 82)
The lesser demons in Karamja and Crandor are an alternative to moss giants at level 65+ Ranged, but are slower experience because of their high Defence, and do not have good drops, only notably dropping rune med helms and fire runes. They always drop vile ashes that can be used for either Prayer training or to be sold on the Grand Exchange for extra money.

Lesser demons in Karamja volcano can be accessed and safespotted from any level, provided you can survive the short sprint past them to one of the safespots. It's recommended to fill your inventory with cheap food for the initial sprint to the safespot, and to heal damage for the first 10 minutes when running out to pick up drops. After 10 minutes, as long as you continue training at the same safespot, the lessers will become tolerant and drops can be safely picked up without taking damage. Since they have a large amount of hitpoints (~80) and high defence, and training is completely safe after the first 10 minutes, lesser demons are a common place for players to afk train Ranged.

Ankou (combat levels 75, 82 or 86)
Ankou are another alternative to moss giants for players with 60+ Ranged, and although the level 75 ankou can have Defence lower than lesser demons, the level 82 and 86 ones that have safespots have much higher Defence and are slower experience. Ankou have very few good drops in free-to-play, which include law runes, left skull halves which can be chiseled into bone fragments, noted mithril ore, or noted rune essence for ironmen.

Ankou can be found either in the Stronghold of Security level 4 or The Forgotten Cemetery in level 30 Wilderness. They are aggressive to players of all combat levels but can be safespotted at both locations, most easily over a skeleton on the floor in the south-western room of Stronghold of Security level 4.

===== Pay-to-play Prayer training =====
Training Prayer can be quite costly, but it is a very important skill due to its utility in combat. 

Many quests recommend having 43 Prayer, as this allows a player to use all available protection prayers. Other important milestones include Level 50 for completing all quests, Level 77 for unlocking all prayers and Level 85 for completing all Achievement Diaries. Having a higher Prayer level also allows the player to restore more prayer points per prayer potion/super restore/sanfew serum dose. 

Starting off
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Prayer experience.

Completing The Restless Ghost, Priest in Peril, Recruitment Drive, and Holy Grail will grant a total of 14,531 Prayer experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 30. Spirits of the Elid has more requirements, but gives another 8,000 Prayer experience.

Active training
Cremating urium remains

Cremating urium remains only rewards 35,000 Prayer experience per hour (or up to to 57,000 Prayer experience per hour with Hard Morytania Diary and max efficiency), but it is the fastest way to obtain the zealot's robes. The robes provide a 1.25% chance per piece to prevent various remains from being consumed whilst training Prayer – totalling 5% with the full set equipped. Given that most Prayer training methods are relatively expensive, the zealot's robes can be beneficial to obtain early. 

At an average cost of 8 gp/xp, 1 million Prayer experience would normally cost  and the zealot's robes would reduce that amount by . 

On average, 512 gold keys are needed to obtain the full zealot's set, which calls for cremating approximately 648 urium remains at level 95 Firemaking (or 3,273 fiyr remains at level 80 Firemaking). Cremating 648 urium remains would cost  upfront and take approximately 2-3 hours. The rewards from cremating the remains typically make this a profitable activity in addition to earning the full set of zealot's robes.

Offering bones at a gilded altar
160px|right
The fastest way to train Prayer is to offer bones at a gilded altar in a player-owned house. When both incense burners are lit, the altar gives 350% experience per bone when a bone is offered at it. For example, burying a dragon bone gives 72 Prayer experience, but using it on the gilded altar with two incense burners lit would give 252 experience. While this method is the fastest way to train Prayer, it is also very expensive. Players who seek to save money are advised to offer bones at the Chaos altar in the Wilderness instead, as this is only slightly slower but offers twice as much experience per bone when compared to the gilded altar.

Building a gilded altar requires level 75 Construction, which can be boosted. The tier of incense burner does not matter, as all three types (oak, mahogany, and marble) yield the same experience bonus and remain lit for the same amount of time. Lighting an incense burner requires level 30 Firemaking and a marrentill herb, and both incense burners must be lit for the highest experience bonus. It is also recommended to have level 45 Magic for Camelot Teleport and Teleport to House.

Use the bank chest near Camelot Castle in a PvP world when offering bones. It is the closest one to a teleport and within a safe area from player killers. Equip a dust battlestaff, and keep a tinderbox and law runes in the inventory. Withdraw 24 bones and two marrentills, teleport to the house, light the incense burners, and offer the bones at the gilded altar. Use each bone manually at the altar to speed up the process. Teleport back to Camelot and repeat.

Players who do not have the Construction level to build a gilded altar can use the altar of a house party host for free. Ironmen cannot use this method as they are unable to access friend POHs. The official worlds for hosted gilded altars are 330 (US East), 465 (Germany) and 512 (UK) at the Rimmington house portal. Take noted bones and unnote them at Phials located in the Rimmington General Store store for 5 coins each.

Experience rates vary depending on the type of bone used and performance. With good banking and accurate clicks, players can offer 2,550 bones per hour when manually using the bones on the altar. This equates to around 1,340,000 experience per hour when using superior dragon bones, or 643,000 experience per hour when using dragon bones. The rates can be increased up to 3,500 bones per hour if using alternative accounts to light the incense burners and bringing bones from the bank, or even higher if hiring runners. If the player is not manually using the bones on the altar, only up to 1,070 bones per hour can be offered.

More information about experience rates and costs can be seen below. Currently, offering superior dragon bones costs  coins per experience, and dragon bones   coins per experience.

Offering blessed bone shards to the libation bowl
thumb|200px|Sacrificing blessed bone shards at the libation bowl.
Requiring level 30 Prayer, offering blessed bone shards to the libation bowl within the Teomat is slightly slower, but offers more experience per bone compared to the gilded altar.

Fill the bowl with either jugs of blessed wine or jugs of blessed sunfire wine, then sacrifice blessed bone shards as an offering for either 5 or 6 Prayer experience per shard. One jug of blessed wine fills the libation bowl enough for 400 blessed bone shards to be sacrificed in total. Each offering drains two Prayer points; players can recharge their prayer at the Shrine of Ralos in the southern building.

Up to 100 blessed bone shards can be sacrificed per action, for a total of either 500 or 600 Prayer experience. Sacrificing happens automatically (4 ticks per action) so long as the player has remaining jugs of blessed wine, blessed bone shards, and Prayer points. Sacrificing can also be sped up (1 tick per action) by clicking manually.

With a full inventory of 27 jugs of blessed sunfire wine, a player could sacrifice up to 10,800 bone shards per inventory, awarding 64,800 Prayer experience in only 65 seconds of sacrificing. Of course, this would also drain 216 Prayer points, so a few trips would need to be made to restore Prayer points at the Shrine of Ralos nearby.

The zealot's robes do have a chance to save sacrificed blessed bone shards, and can trigger separately for each individual shard (rather than per sacrifice of 100). They will not save "charges" of the filled libation bowl, however.

 Obtaining shards 
The fastest way to obtain blessed bone shards is to bless bones at the exposed altar nearby, then break them down with a chisel; the amount of shards received is dependent on the type of bone blessed. Virilis at the bottom of the altar will un-note bones for 10 gp per item.

Bones are broken down automatically (4 ticks per action). This can be sped up (0 ticks per action) by using the chisel on blessed bones manually. With active effort, around 4,000 bones can be un-noted, blessed, and broken down per hour; otherwise 1,000 bones can be broken down automatically.

Aside from monster remains, there are alternative ways of obtaining blessed bone shards. For example, mining Calcified rocks in the Cam Torum mine is a relatively AFK method of receiving bone shards; around 2,200 shards can be banked per hour (including trips to break down calcified deposits), netting around 11,000 to 13,200 banked Prayer XP per hour. With optimal gear, levels and focus, upwards of 20,000 banked Prayer XP per hour can be obtained this way.

 Obtaining blessed wine 
The Culinaromancer's Chest sells both jugs and grapes and has a nearby sink for filling the jug, making it an ideal location for creating jugs of wine. They may also be purchased, with the closest shop to a bank being Sunlight's Sanctum in Aldarin which offers an unlimited supply.

Jugs of wine must be blessed at the exposed altar nearby into jugs of blessed wine. Alternatively, two sunfire splinters can be used on a jug of wine first to convert it into a jug of sunfire wine, which becomes a jug of blessed sunfire wine when brought to the exposed altar and grants 20% extra Prayer experience per shard.

With active effort, adding sunfire splinters to around 6,000 wines per hour can be expected. Automatic creation of sunfire wine takes 2.4 seconds each, so 1,500 wines per hour would be the theoretical limit.

As blessed wine cannot be banked, it is recommended that players only bring and bless wines at the exposed altar in proportion to the amount of shards they have.

General strategy
thumb|Demonstration of auto chiselling the bones at double speed.
 Break down the desired amount of bones into blessed bone shards.
 Bring a chisel and noted bones to Virilis at the Teomat, who charges 10 coins for each bone un-noted.
 Bless the bones at the exposed altar.
 Break the bones down into blessed bone shards. You can substantially speed this by repeatedly using the chisel on the bones. If you do not want to spam click, you can still automatically process them at double speed by clicking "Break-down" on one bone, and then "Use"ing a chisel on another within the same tick.
 Run back to Virilis and repeat.
 Offer the blessed bone shards to the libation bowl.
 Bring your blessed bone shards and a full inventory of (sunfire) wine to the Teomat. Optional: Make jugs of sunfire wine while running by using sunfire splinters on a pestle and mortar with the wines present in your inventory. This process can also be sped up by using the sunfire splinters on the pestle and mortar repeatedly.
 Bless the wines at the exposed altar.
 Sacrifice at the libation bowl. You can repeatedly click the libation bowl to perform sacrifices faster.
 Restore prayer as needed at the Shrine of Ralos. Optional: Use prayer potions or a Falador shield for higher efficiency.
 Bank and repeat. The quickest way is to teleport to a bank using an equipped item such as a ring of dueling, then returing to Ralos's Rise using a pendant of ates.

 Restoring stamina 
For extended Prayer training sessions, players may need to restore stamina occasionally. An easy way to bank without any additional items is to use the quetzal transport at the Teomat to Quetzacalli Gorge. Another method that does not take up an inventory slot involves equipping a ring of dueling to teleport to Fortis Colosseum where there is both a bank and a quetzal nearby for fast transport back to the Teomat; this requires Hero status in the Colosseum. Alternative methods of restoring run energy without taking up an inventory space include a Construction cape (provided players have a Revitalisation pool in their home), a Desert amulet 4 to teleport to the Elidinis Statuette in Nardah, or drinking a stamina potion at the bank.

The Teomat has a list of other methods of efficient transportation after banking.

 Experience rates 
As the whole process of gaining experience is quite complex, the experience rates below are only estimates.

For a comparison of experience rates and cost across different Prayer training methods, see further below.

 By using existing shards 
As prayer points are drained while sacrificing, recharging prayer periodically is required. The player's prayer level determines how many recharge trips are required to use up one inventory of wine. Recharging at the nearby altar and returning to the bowl takes ~25 seconds. Assuming that replenishing supplies (banking for wine, blessing it, and recharging prayer) takes around 65 seconds, it is not efficient to do another prayer recharge run if less than 40% of one prayer bar worth of wine is left - it is more efficient to bank.

Prayer restoration is a major component of the entire cycle time; by using prayer potions there is no need to leave the bowl and even higher rates can be attained. Supposing Sunfire splinters are losslessly added to Jugs of wine during the run from the Quetzal to the Exposed altar, with an inventory consisting of a stack of Sunfire splinters, a stack of Blessed bone shards, a Pestle and mortar, 184 Prayer points worth of potions (Above level 64 Prayer, 2 Prayer potions will suffice, from level 56 Prayer until 64, 2 Super restores will also suffice) and the remaining 23 inventory slots filled with Jugs of wine, an optimal run takes approximately 200 ticks (2 minutes); At this rate up to 1,656,000 XP/h could be achieved. Pre-preparing the Jugs of blessed sunfire wine or taking advantage of other accounts using Moonlight moth mixes nearby the Libation pool to save two inventory spaces allows for 25 Jugs of wine per run, equating to 208 ticks (2 minutes and 4.8 seconds) per round trip and approximately 1,730,000 XP/h. Through the use of alt accounts to use Moonlight moth mixes and supply additional Jugs of wine, running back and forth between the Libation pool and the Exposed altar, a full round of 25 Jugs of blessed sunfire wine would take an optimal 174 ticks (1 minute and 44.4 seconds) and would equate to approximately 2,069,000 XP/h.

 By preparing sunfire wines 
Assuming active effort is used for 5500 wines per hour, creation of sunfire wines adds around 16 seconds to the total trip time. That means trip length is 5-10% longer, but considering it adds 20% XP per shard, it is worthwhile in terms of efficiency.

 By making shards 
If the player produces their own shards from bones, the experience rates drop depending on the bones used. Assuming 4000 bones are processed per hour and 25 wines per inventory (10,000 shards) are used, some example time penalties can be found in the table below. The table shows that with dragon bones, the shard preparation time is quite similar to the time taken to sacrifice shards with a full inventory of wines at levels 62-99 when including sunfire wine preparation - meaning that for the aforementioned setup, all-in-all XP rate is about half of what is shown in the table above.

For example, 4000 dragon bones provide 232,000 shards, taking 155 seconds per 10,000 shards. Since 10,000 shards take 147 seconds to sacrifice at level 88+ Prayer, making your own shards roughly doubles the amount of time spent sacrificing (155 seconds added to the original 147 seconds).

Offering bones at the Chaos Temple
300px|right
Offering bones at the altar within the Chaos Temple in the Wilderness is a slightly slower but a much cheaper alternative to the gilded altar. The temple is located in level 38 Wilderness, in a multi-combat area, so great caution must be exercised while employing this training method. The temple has an altar which grants 350% experience per bone offered at it (the same experience as a gilded altar with two burners lit), but also gives a 50% chance for the bone not to be consumed. This effectively doubles the amount of experience received per bone.  However, using the altar comes at the risk of having to face player killers who frequently like to hop between worlds at the location.

Players can take noted bones and un-note them at the Elder Chaos druid just outside of the temple for 50 coins per note (except on Deadman Mode worlds, where his service is not offered to Deadmen). While convenient, this also increases the amount that the player is risking to player killers. Players who wish to minimise risk can take only an inventory of unnoted bones at a time and suicide to bank for more bones.

The fastest way to get to the altar is to use Ghorrock Teleport (or the respective house portal or the teleport tablet) and run south.
Alternatively, players who have an Ancient Obelisk in their player-owned house and have completed hard Wilderness Diary can use it to teleport to level 44 Wilderness and then run south.
 Another option is to use Cemetery Teleport on the Arceuus spellbook or the respective house portal and run north. This is a slightly slower method, but it has lower requirements.
Using the burning amulet to the Lava Maze entrance and running south-west is not recommended, except for players using the suicide strategy below. The Lava Maze entrance is often crowded by player killers due to its proximity to Revenant Caves and King Black Dragon Lair.

Experience rates vary depending on the bone used and the number of player killers. When bringing noted bones and manually using the bones on the altar, players can gain up to 1,800,000 experience per hour with superior dragon bones or 860,000 experience per hour with dragon bones. Higher rates can be achieved by using runners. If suiciding for every inventory of bones, players can offer up to around 2,000 bones per hour. This would equate to 1,050,000 experience per hour with superior dragon bones and 500,000 experience per hour with dragon bones.

Strategies
As the altar can also be used to recharge Prayer points, players can keep Protect from Magic and Augury prayers up while offering bones and pray at the altar when needed.

Planning to die

Players who wish to minimise the risk can travel to the altar from the bank for every inventory of bones, and suicide to get to the bank faster. While this is less risky than bringing noted bones to the altar, it is also slower.

For this method, it is strongly recommended to have the respawn point in Ferox Enclave or Edgeville. They are the closest respawn points to a bank, but also cost 5,000,000 coins to unlock. Alternatively, players can use PvP worlds, which have a bank chest right next to a respawn point.

This method goes as follows:
Take bones, a teleport to the Wilderness, and optionally a locator orb, enchanted symbol or a dwarven rock cake from the bank.
Teleport to the Wilderness, and run to the Chaos Temple. Offer the bones at the altar.
Lower Hitpoints with the locator orb or the dwarven rock cake, and suicide to the wine of zamorak spawn. Alternatively, let the Chaos Fanatic kill you.
Run from the respawn point to the nearest bank for more bones. Repeat the process.

Players can optionally wear a piece of defensive equipment, such as the Dinh's bulwark. This way, players have a better chance of surviving player killers long enough so they can use up all their bones before dying.

Alternatively, players can wear Zealot's robes when using the suicide strategy. The bone-saving effect of the altar stacks with the Zealot's robes, and wearing them would give slightly more value out of the bones. The Zealot's robes are protected over the bones on death.

 Logging out
If a player wishes to avoid encounters with player killers, an option is to keep the logout menu open with the cursor placed over the logout button. Consider using the ::renderself chat interface setting to hide your character model on your own client, allowing you to see anyone who logs in beneath you. With careful attention, the player can quickly log out before being attacked. One disadvantage to this method is that it offers lower XP/hr than manually using the bones on the altar.

Bringing noted bones 
Bringing noted bones is riskier, but a lot faster than using the suicide method. However, it is only viable for either high-level or very low-level players.

The Elder Chaos Druid located outside the Chaos Altar unnotes bones for 50 coins each.

Very low-level players (combat level 3–20) are often too low-levelled to be targeted by player killers. Such players can usually bring higher amounts of noted bones with lower risk. However, some low-level combat pure player killers can sometimes be found at the altar, so some caution should still be given.

High-level players should wear good defensive gear while 3- or 4-iteming more expensive armour pieces, and bring some Saradomin brews along with sanfew serums or super restores to have a higher chance of escaping player killers. Players will also have very limited space for supplies, as it is best to have as much inventory space as possible for the bones.

Gear setups can vary depending on how much money the player has available. It is generally best prioritise Magic defence while having decent defensive bonuses against Melee and Ranged attacks. When choosing protected items, the fortified Masori body or the Armadyl chestplate, a tank shield such as elysian/spectral spirit shield or dinh's bulwark, and staff of the dead (if using an off-hand shield) are considered the best options. The rest of the equipment should consist of fairly cheap or easily replaceable items.

If the player is confident using Protect Item, the serpentine helm or the fortified Masori chaps (or the Armadyl chainskirt) can be brought as the extra item. It is still possible to get smited, so it may be a good idea to keep the smite risk reasonable. In a certain death situation prioritise having enough Prayer points to keep Protect Item active.

Smite risks for certain items:
Serpentine helm: 
Staff of the dead: 
Slayer helmet (i): 
Karil's leatherskirt: 

Generally it is best to wear a phoenix necklace to reduce the chance of getting combo-ed out along with a ring of wealth, which offers a teleport out of the Wilderness while not taking up inventory space. With certain setups it may be better to bring a ring of suffering (i) and an amulet of glory for extra defence, although the player will miss out on the phoenix necklace's healing effect.

|-|
High Magic defence =
Using the staff of the dead with a powerful off-hand shield (such as the elysian or spectral spirit shield) offers the highest escaping potential. Having a very high Magic defence helps at not getting frozen inside the multi-combat area, thereby significantly increasing the chances of surviving. Players should keep the risk at a reasonable level, as it is still fairly likely to die to a larger team of player killers. Choose 3 pieces of equipment (4 if confident using Protect Item) that will be protected on death and some low-value equipment that you do not mind risking.

The elysian spirit shield is the best option for overall tanking due to its damage reduction effect. However, the spectral spirit shield is much more affordable and arguably almost as good due to its considerably higher Magic defence bonus. Wearing the spectral spirit shield makes it a lot less likely to get frozen inside the multi-combat area, but should this happen, the elysian spirit shield offers much better survivability.

The staff of the dead has fairly high Magic defence and also offers a useful special attack, which halves the all Melee damage of your opponent(s) (all opponents that hit you in the time of the special attack) for one minute. A staff of light or staff of balance can also used instead as they have the exact same bonuses and special attack. Should the player not be able to use the staff of the dead, any other staff with high Magic defence bonus should be used instead.

Reanimating ensouled heads
220x220px|right
Reanimating ensouled heads and killing the reanimated monsters near the Dark Altar is a relatively slow training method, but it requires less effort than manually offering bones at a gilded altar or the Chaos altar. This method is mainly recommended for players who wish to save money on Prayer training and do not wish to go to the Wilderness, as offering bones at the Chaos altar offers a lot faster experience and is usually comparable in terms of cost.

For this method, using fairy ring code  for faster access to the Dark Altar, and a fast access to fairy rings, such as the fairy ring in the POH, quest point cape, or using the Salve Graveyard Teleport. Having the rune pouch is strongly recommended to save inventory space. It is also recommended to buy the ensouled heads in advance, as most of them have a low trade volumes on the Grand Exchange.

Experience rates vary depending on the type of ensouled head used and combat stats. With high combat stats, players can reanimate up to 220 ensouled heads per hour. This equates to around 343,000 experience per hour when reanimating ensouled dragon heads. Higher rates can be achieved by using a cannon to kill the reanimated monsters faster, but this makes the method slightly more expensive. Players will also gain some passive combat and Magic experience from this method.

More information about experience rates and costs can be seen at the calculator page.
Experience rates assume 220 reanimated monsters are killed per hour. Slightly higher rates can be achieved by using the dwarf multicannon to kill reanimated monsters faster.
GP/XP includes the cost of the ensouled head and the runes required to cast the respective spell. It does not include the cost of supplies (such as super combat potions) or teleports.

Offering spells
With the upgraded Arceuus spellbook from A Kingdom Divided, players can offer bones or demonic ashes from their inventory, offering simultaneous Magic experience.

Demonic Offering

Since the three highest level Slayer masters assign at least 120 abyssal demons as a minimum, one can expect at least of 30,600 Prayer experience per task if casting the demonic offering spell on abyssal ashes, making that particular task a great passive training method for players who melee the monsters. Also, one may collect abyssal ashes from the floor in worlds where there is another player barraging, for a low intensity and cheap method.

 Offering bones at the Ectofuntus 
Worshiping the Ectofuntus gives 400% the normal experience. Although this is the second-highest guaranteed per-bone prayer bonus in the game, this is much less than the 700% theoretical average experience at the Chaos Altar. This is due to the 50% chance of the Chaos Altar not consuming bones. The libation bowl will either match the 400% increase in xp per bone, or exceed it, depending on the bone sacrificed and whether or not sunfire wine is used.

The Ectofuntus is a less common method of training prayer due to it being much slower and not much cheaper than gilded altars, but it can be sped up considerably with the daily rewards provided by the Morytania Diaries.

Passive training
Passive training can be the cheapest Prayer training method, and take no additional time, especially when combined with Slayer training or in the Nightmare Zone or similar areas where players plan to stay for a long time without banking their drops.

 Bonecrusher 
With the bonecrusher or bonecrusher necklace, when charged with ecto-tokens, if the player kills a monster that drops bones, the bonecrusher will automatically crush them, granting the player half the Prayer experience they would have received from burying the bones themselves, or full amount of experience if the elite Morytania Diary is completed, and consuming one charge.

 Ash sanctifier 
With the ash sanctifier, when charged with death runes, if the player kills a monster that drops ashes, the sanctifier will automatically scatter them, granting the player half the Prayer experience they would have received from scattering the ashes themselves, or full amount of experience if the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary is completed, and consuming one charge.

 Reanimating ensouled heads 
Ensouled heads can be reanimated to passively train Prayer during Slayer tasks from monsters that drops them, such as Bloodvelds or Abyssal Demons. Reanimation spells can be directly cast on ensouled heads dropped on the ground from monsters as long as the player do not bank them. In addition, reanimated monsters counts toward Slayer tasks, with the exception of Reanimated dragons.

 Ectoplasmator 
With the ectoplasmator, if the player kills a spectral creature such as an aberrant spectre, the player receives Prayer experience equal to 20% of the monster's max health, rounded down. The ectoplasmator requires 40 Prayer, and it is a reward from the Soul Wars minigame for 250 Zeal Tokens. In addition, the ectoplasmator stacks with the bonecrusher when killing a spectral monster that also drops bones, like ankou.

 Bird's Eggs 
Occasionally, while woodcutting or emptying Bird houses, a bird's nest containing red, green, or blue bird's eggs can be obtained. These can be offered to the shrine at the woodcutting guild for 100 prayer xp each, allowing some passive experience while training other skills.

Experience rates and cost
For a dynamic calculator with user inputs, see Calculator:Prayer.

Comparison between bone offering methods
The table below compares the three primary methods of Prayer training for each type of bone at a gilded altar with two burners lit, the Chaos altar, and shards at the libation bowl. It does not include burying bones or using the Ectofuntus; for those methods, see Calculator:Prayer/Bones.

This table assumes you manually 'use' bones on altars/chisels for faster experience. This results in 2,550 bones/hour offered at a gilded altar, 2,000 bones/hour offered at the Chaos altar (costing only 1,000 bones/hour), and 1,700 bones/hour blessed + chiseled + offered at the libation bowl.
Experience rates do not assume using alternative accounts for running bones and/or lighting burners. If using one, you can expect to achieve rates 20–25% higher at a gilded altar, 40–45% higher at the Chaos altar, and perhaps 30-35% higher at the libation bowl.
GP/XP for the Chaos altar assumes effectively getting twice the experience per bone. It also includes the 50 coins unnoting fee per bone (which effectively only applies to half the bones), but does not include the cost of teleports, supplies and potential loss to player killers.
XP/hour for the libation bowl assumes having level 62+ Prayer for 3 prayer recharges per inventory of wine. It is also based on the number of inventories of wine required by dragon bones; lower-tier bones will require fewer trips to the libation bowl due to producing fewer shards/hour, slightly increasing the XP/hour shown here; higher-tier bones will require more trips to the libation bowl, slightly reducing XP/hour shown here. See Calculator:Prayer/Blessed_Bone_Shards for a more precise breakdown with user inputs.
GP/hour for the libation bowl assumes using sunfire splinters and paying Virilis to un-note bones.

Efficiency

Because most Prayer training methods are available to players regardless of Prayer level, a main differentiator between training methods and bone choice is cost (coins per experience) and speed (experience per hour).

Imagine a choice between two made-up bones:
 Small Bones cost  each and grant 100 XP when buried ( per XP)
 Large Bones cost  each and grant 200 XP when buried ( per XP)

If you can feasibly bury 2,500 bones per hour, that means:
 Small Bones provide 250,000 XP per hour.
 Large Bones provide 500,000 XP per hour.

At first glance, paying twice as much per XP in order to gain XP twice as fast may seem like a reasonable tradeoff. However, the final factor is actual time saved, also called efficiency. Imagine you'd like to train Prayer from level 60 to level 70, requiring a total of roughly 500,000 XP. To gain that much XP:
 Small Bones would take 2 hours and cost .
 Large Bones would take 1 hour and cost .

That means it costs  more to save 1 hour of time if you choose Large Bones instead of Small Bones in this made-up scenario. This would only ever be worthwhile if you can feasibly earn more than  per hour with your time, or simply prefer doing other activities enough to accept the cost associated with saving that time.

In other words, if you can earn  per hour doing some activity as your primary money-making method, then in order to afford training to level 70 Prayer:
 You would need to spend 5 hours making money if using Small Bones (5 + 2 = 7 hours total to 70 Prayer).
 You would need to spend 10 hours making money if using Large Bones (10 + 1 = 11 hours total to 70 Prayer).

===== Free-to-play Prayer training =====
Prayer is regarded to be the most difficult skill to train in free-to-play due to the expense involved in purchasing large numbers of remains from the Grand Exchange, low experience rates, and the high amount of clicking required to train the skill.

Starting off
The Restless Ghost provides you with 1,125 Prayer experience which allows a player to raise Prayer from level 1 to 9 upon completion. There are no requirements to begin this quest (melee defensive armour is optional but useful) and is strongly recommended for beginning players as it provides a fairly decent amount of experience for relatively little effort.

Prayer melee
If your desire is to maximise prayer bonus to be able to use prayers for a longer period of time in melee combat, this is the best-in-slot for prayer bonuses. This also suggests that the player has protection prayers unlocked to negate damage ( for Protect from Magic,  for Protect from Missiles, and  for Protect from Melee); otherwise, use the best-in-slot melee table to fill in the rest of the slots for defence bonuses.

When fighting against greater demons in the Demonic Ruins with melee while sustaining prayer with the Demonic Ruins' passive ability of restoring prayer, it is recommended to only bring a holy symbol, monk's robe top, monk's robe, and rune mace, and optionally two other items (three other items if using Protect Item). Keep in mind that rune full helm drops obtain from killing greater demons may take up slots for protected items on death. Monk's robes are always easily replaceable should the player die by another player. A holy symbol can be remade from scratch should the player lose it, but to reduce time required to obtain another one, multiple holy symbols should be crafted and blessed by Brother Jered in one inventory. The rune mace will usually be protected on death if not an File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png Ultimate Ironman or skulled.

Camdozaal
Offering fish at the altar in the Ruins of Camdozaal is a less click-intensive method of training prayer, requiring at least 7 Fishing and Cooking and completion of the Below Ice Mountain quest. Having 33 Fishing and Cooking is recommended to fish for tetra, which provide the most prayer experience among the free-to-play fish. Tetra stop ruining at Cooking level 61. However, players can stop ruining tetra around level 54 Cooking if they purchase the Preparation buff from Ramarno's Shard Exchange for 2500 Barronite shards. Purchasing the Fishing and Preparation buffs from Ramarno's shard exchange slightly increases the experience rates for lower Fishing and Cooking levels respectively.
Use a small fishing net to catch fish in the fishing spot nearby. A small fishing net spawn is located near the waterfall, and not marked on the minimap. Only the fishing spots with 'Small Net' and 'Big Net' options will work for this (the singular other type of fishing spot is Members only).
Prepare these fish at the preparation table using a knife. You'll gain Cooking experience. A knife lies on the floor nearby the table.
You can increase the speed of fish preparation by repeatedly clicking and  preparing fish on a 3 tick cycle, instead of clicking once and letting it take the normal 4 ticks. This is a form of tick manipulation.
Offer the prepared fish at the altar for Prayer experience.

FishLevelExpLevelExpLevelExp7871214201620231733243331110
Experience rates are 5,600 Fishing, 7,400 Cooking, and 2,400 Prayer experience per hour or less when offering all fish types (only possible at Level 61+ cooking, when tetra stop ruining) with decent efficiency and no tick manipulation.

Wilderness
Bone Yard

The Bone Yard in the Wilderness (directly north of Varrock) has many spawns of bones and a few spawns of big bones with no killing required.

Recommendations
Food (optional) - There are multiple level 20–25 skeletons in this area. Be sure to bring enough food to last for a while if you do not wish to fight them.
Armour - Due to the fact that this is the Wilderness and that there are skeletons in this area, it is recommended that players wear armour they do not mind losing.
A weapon (optional) - If you choose to fight the skeletons, you can also gain a slight amount of experience just from that. They also drop bones.

Strategy
There are multiple strategies you could use for this method. Any way works, which one is best is for you to decide.

Method one:
Run in and collect bones.
Run out to safety and bury the bones.
Repeat.

Method two:
Fight skeletons to obtain their bones as well. A higher combat level would make this easier.
Once the area is safe, collect all bones.
Bury all bones.
Repeat.

Method three:
While this method will delay the start of prayer training, if you enter two aggressive areas among the piles of bones, skeletons will no longer be aggressive in those areas after waiting 10 minutes.
Make sure you don't go away too far that would cause you to enter a new aggressive area, otherwise skeletons will be aggressive again for another 10 minutes.
World hopping will not reset the aggression timer.
With this method, food and armour will not be needed and without having any weighted items on you (thus, having 0 kg of weight), you can run around burying bones for a longer period of time before running out of run energy.
With this method, while you will have to wait 10 minutes to start training, you can expect a faster experience rate than the other two methods once you start running to collect and bury bones non-stop.

You can always find what works for yourself as well.

Chaos Temple
Burying bones at the south-east Chaos Temple ruins in the Wilderness is more click-intensive but it is located in a lower-leveled Wilderness area (Levels 11–12) making it a slightly safer alternative to the Bone Yard, plus there are no monsters located in this area in free-to-play worlds. The idea would be to bury the bones inside the temple ruins on the western and southern side and hop between two worlds. Ignore the lone bones on the north-eastern side inside the temple ruin (to maintain run energy) and the bones outside the temple ruins.

Combat
Low-level areas
Many low level areas consist of people killing monsters. People often do not pick up the bones that lie on the ground, therefore there is often an endless supply of free bones.

Areas and enemies include:
Lumbridge Swamp
Chicken pens
Cow fields
Goblins (e.g. near the gate to Al Kharid)
Imps (commonly found south of Falador) drop fiendish ashes that give 10 Prayer experience when scattered.

There are of course more spots, but these are amongst the most common spots for people to be leaving loot on the ground.

High-level areas
Big bones are dropped by the following monsters in free-to-play in these areas.
Giant frogs (Lumbridge Swamp)
Hill giants (Edgeville Dungeon or Giants' Plateau)
Moss giants (Varrock Sewers or Crandor)
Ice giants (Asgarnian Ice Dungeon)
Ogresses (Corsair Cove Dungeon)

Vile ashes are dropped by the following monsters in free-to-play in these areas.
Lesser demons (Crandor and Karamja Dungeon, Lava Maze, or Demonic Ruins)
Greater demons (Demonic Ruins)

Among the higher-level monsters that drop big bones or ashes, killing giant frogs is the fastest due to their low hitpoints and defence. Killing lesser demons at higher levels would give more profit, but has a lower prayer experience rate.

Power-burying and scattering
The best prayer experience rates for prayer in free-to-play are achieved by burying large numbers of bones and demonic ashes bought from the Grand Exchange. This is a click intensive and expensive method for training the skill. The high cost can be offset by a focus on efficiently making money.

The fastest method of training Prayer would be burying big bones and scattering vile ashes at the same time as bones and ashes can be buried and scattered simultaneously, granting the player 40 Prayer experience in a single tick within two quick clicks, up to a little less than 116,000 experience per hour within a combination of 2,900 buries and scatters per hour. However, players realistically won't achieve that high with the amount of clicking and banking, realistically reaching around ~100,000 experience per hour. From Levels 1 to 99, this method would require 325,861 big bones () and 325,861 vile ashes ().

 Buying a bond 
It should be noted that training Prayer as a member is significantly more cost-effective, so you may want to postpone training until after you become member. One could consider buying a bond and using a members method of training prayer. With the current price of a bond at  and dragon bones at , getting to level 99 would require one bond and 51,724 dragon bones when using a gilded altar. The total price would be , which is  cheaper than using big bones. When compared to burying and scattering this would save the player about 92 hours (20 hours compared to 112 hours).

===== Pay-to-play Magic training =====
Magic can be trained passively while training other skills. The passive training methods can be tedious or expensive before High Level Alchemy becomes available, so consider low-effort or cheaper alternatives to get through the early levels.

At higher levels, Magic can be trained much faster through casting multi-target burst or barrage spells on Ancient Magicks. An efficient way to do this is on Slayer tasks, as certain Slayer monsters (such as dust devils and Greater Nechryael) can be bursted or barraged for fast Slayer experience.

In terms of macro-efficiency, defensive attack style may be used to gain more overall experience (1 Defence xp + 1.33 Magic xp on defensive vs 2 Magic xp on standard) when training via combat. Defensive casting is a viable way to train Defence at lower levels while melee training prioritises Strength and Attack to meet Warrior's Guild entry requirements, as well as at higher levels where cost per Magic xp is not a concern. However, standard casting offers the highest pure magic experience, which might be preferable to players seeking to minimise costs.

Levels 1–55: Starting off
Levels 1–10/34: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Magic experience. Completing Witch's Potion and Imp Catcher gives a total of 1,200 Magic experience, which is enough to get from level 1 to 10. Both quests are very short and have no requirements, and they can be done at any level.

To get to level 34 only by questing, completing Fairytale I - Growing Pains or The Grand Tree allows Watchtower to be completed. Completing all three and Lumbridge Guide subquest of Recipe for Disaster would grant an additional 20,900 experience and get the player up to level 34.

Levels 4–55/99: Enchanting bolts
Enchanting gem-tipped bolts using the Enchant Crossbow Bolt spell is one of the fastest ways to train magic and can be done while running or doing other activities. Each cast enchants a set of 10 bolts, and is automatically done every 3 ticks for 10 sets. With accurate timing, players can speed up the process by holding down the space bar and rapidly clicking on the spell. This way the spell can be cast every tick, which increases experience rates by an even larger amount. 

Since bolts and runes are stackable, bolts are easily enchanted while doing other activities, such as questing, training Agility, or while running. Additionally, casting the spell does not interrupt other actions. 

However, this method can be very expensive, so it is only recommended for players who wish to progress through  early levels as fast as possible and are willing to invest large amounts of gp. Players who plan to train Magic passively while doing other activities are advised to switch to casting Low Level Alchemy at level 21, as this is much cheaper. At level 55, it is recommended to switch to casting High Level Alchemy, which provides higher xp/cast and is more profitable. 

Experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. Note that the prices may be inaccurate due to low trade volumes. Some options may also not be viable due to low supply.

Levels 7–21: Lvl-1 Enchant
From level 7 to 21, enchant sapphire or opal jewellery by using the Lvl-1 Enchant spell. The spell can be cast manually every 3 ticks, and each cast gives 17.5 experience.

Players can gain up to around 32,000 experience per hour. It will take 250 casts to get from level 7 to 21.

Another option is to cast this spell in the Mage Training Arena, which will yield much greater experience, and pizazz points in the minigame.

Levels 21–55: Low Level Alchemy
At level 21, cast Low Level Alchemy (also known as "low alching") to convert items into coins. The spell can be cast every 3 ticks, and each cast gives 31 experience. This method can be done while doing other activities, such as questing, training Agility, or while running.

Cast Low Level Alchemy on noted items or stacks of items bought from the Grand Exchange. To decide what items to cast Low Level Alchemy on, see this calculator for more details. Cast the spell on cheap items, such as rune arrows. Using more expensive items (such as rune armour pieces) will result in a loss due to their price being tied to their High Alchemy value. Because of this, this method will likely result in a small loss.

Another option is to cast this spell in the Mage Training Arena, which will yield much greater experience, and pizazz points in the minigame.

Players can gain up to around 60,000 experience per hour if standing still. Expect much lower rates when doing other activities. It would take 5,214 casts to get from level 21 to 55.

Levels 1–55: Other early training methods
Levels 1–55: Killing crabs
Killing crabs with combat spells requires very little attention and offers relatively fast experience at lower levels. Use the highest-level combat spell available for the best damage output. Players who wish to spend less money on Magic training may want to keep using Fire Strike instead of switching to the more expensive bolt and blast spells. Chaos gauntlets (requires completion of Family Crest) can be used with Fire Bolt to achieve a max hit of one below that of Fire Blast, to achieve higher experiences rates without the increased cost. If you are waiting for respawns, consider switching to a denser spawn or a higher Hitpoints crab. If you are taking too much damage from crabs, consider moving to a smaller spawn or lower Hitpoints crab.

There are five types of crabs the player can train on, and all have high Hitpoints, very low Defence and deal minimal damage. They become aggressive when walked by, and stay aggressive for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the player has to reset aggressiveness by running away far enough, usually a minimap's length. The player should choose a spot that makes two or three spawns aggressive at the same time.

Ammonite Crabs on Fossil Island (requires Bone Voyage quest). Considered the best crab for training, each crab has 100 Hitpoints. Spawn areas are normally incredibly busy. They also drop unidentified fossils, which can be turned in for experience lamps in Varrock Museum after cleaning. Wind Blast or greater recommended, unless using Chaos gauntlets.
Sand Crabs in Hosidius. They have 60 Hitpoints and have no quest requirements, but are usually crowded.
Rock Crabs in Rellekka. They have no quest requirements and are usually less crowded than Sand Crabs and Ammonite Crabs, but only have 50 Hitpoints.
Frost Crabs in the Ruins of Tapoyauik dungeon in Varlamore. They have 60 Hitpoints and require completion of The Heart of Darkness quest. They have a 100% elemental weakness to fire spells which means they take double the normal damage from Fire Strike and Fire Bolt.
Gemstone Crab in Tlati Rainforest in Varlamore. This crab has infinite hitpoints only requires completion of Children of the Sun quest to access. It will move every 10 minutes requiring the player to travel through a nearby cave to get to the next spawn location. If you are standing off the side of the crab it will not do damage to you. Making this a good monster to train your magic on early as you can train on it entirely safely.

Having at least level 30 Defence is recommended before starting Magic training on these monsters to mitigate the damage. If the player has low Defence, bring some food and use defensive equipment that does not penalise Magic accuracy too much.

Equip any staff that can autocast combat spells. Elemental staves are recommended, as they also provide unlimited elemental runes corresponding to their type (a staff of air provides unlimited air runes). At level 30 Magic and Attack, use a smoke battlestaff if the player can afford one. This staff provides a 10% increase in accuracy and damage when casting spells from the standard spellbook, which will increase experience rates.

Levels 1–55: Exploiting elemental weaknesses
Elemental weaknesses increase both accuracy and damage on their corresponding elemental spell by a certain percentage, and commonly-accessible monsters have up to 100% elemental weakness. This allows cheap, effective, more efficient magic training than killing elementally-neutral monsters, though will provide less AFK time than standard crabs.

100% weaknesses double the corresponding spells' damage, allowing, assuming no other damage bonuses, Strike spells to hit up to 16 and Bolt spells to hit up to 24 (or 30 with Chaos gauntlets).

Ice Giants are easily accessible and safespottable in areas such as White Wolf Mountain and the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, having no quest requirements. They have 70 Hitpoints, 1 Magic, and a 100% Fire weakness. 
Fire Giants are most easily accessible and safespottable in the Catacombs of Kourend and Giants' Den. Killing Fire Giants in here also allows drops of Ancient shards and Dark Totem pieces. They have 111-150 Hitpoints, 1 Magic, and a 100% Water weakness. (Level 104 Fire Giants have +50 Magic Defence.)
Frost Crabs are accessible in the Ruins of Tapoyauik in Varlamore, requiring completion of The Heart of Darkness quest. They have 60 Hitpoints, 1 Magic, -50 Magic Defence, and a 100% Fire weakness.
Ghosts are plentiful in the north-west passage in the bottom floor of the Stronghold of Security, and are additionally weak to the effects of a salve amulet (i). They have 75-80 Hitpoints, 1 Magic, and a 50% Air weakness (Level 77 ghosts have +55 Magic Defence.). While they are only 50% weak, this is compensated by salve weakness and cost saving effect of Air spells using catalytic runes to cost, as a staff of air will cover all of the elemental runes needed.

Equip any staff that can autocast combat spells. Elemental staves are recommended, as they also provide unlimited elemental runes corresponding to their type (a staff of air provides unlimited air runes). At level 30 Magic and Attack, use a smoke battlestaff if the player can afford one. This staff provides a 10% increase in accuracy and damage when casting spells from the standard spellbook, which will increase experience rates.
Levels 1–55: Splashing combat spells
Splashing combat spells on weak monsters offers very slow experience, but only requires player input once every 20 minutes. To splash, attack an NPC while wearing equipment that gives at least -64 Magic attack bonus. Although no damage is dealt, players will still gain the base experience from casting the spell. Simply equip any staff that can autocast the combat spell used (such as an elemental staff), turn on Auto Retaliate, and interact with the game client every 20 minutes to keep splashing the opponent.

Experience rates vary depending on the spell used, ranging from 6,600 to 37,800 experience per hour. See this page for more details about splashing.

Levels 43–55: Superheat Item
From level 43 to 55, one possible option is to cast Superheat Item to smelt ores into bars. The spell can be cast every 3 ticks, and each cast gives 53 Magic experience. This method offers relatively fast Magic experience at these levels and also gives passive Smithing experience. Casting the spell usually costs some money, depending on the Grand Exchange prices.

With decent focus, players can gain up to 97,000 Magic experience per hour. The amount of Smithing experience gained varies depending on the ore used. It will take 2,195 casts to get from level 43 to 55.

See the Superheat Item page for a table with the cost per experience for each type of bar.

Levels 45–55: Camelot Teleport
Repeatedly casting Camelot Teleport offers around 80,000 experience per hour, with 55.5 experience per cast. Training from level 45 to 55 requires a total of 1,895 law runes, which costs  assuming a staff of air is equipped.

Passive training methods
From level 55 onwards Magic can be feasibly trained passively while doing other activities. Passive training methods may offer slow Magic experience per hour in real time. Players who wish to actively gain Magic experience should consider using faster methods below.

Level 55+: High Level Alchemy
At level 55, cast High Level Alchemy (commonly known as "alching") to convert various items into coins. The spell can be cast every 5 ticks, and each cast gives 65 experience. This is one of the best training methods for gaining passive Magic experience as it can be done while doing other activities, and there are always bulk purchasable items (from the Grand Exchange or players, such as smiths) that allow profiting several hundred of coins per cast.

Cast High Level Alchemy on noted items or stacks of items bought from the Grand Exchange. To decide what items to cast High Level Alchemy on, see this calculator for more details. It is recommended to have spare capital to be able to buy a large number of items and nature runes at once, so the player would not have to constantly buy more once they run out. Cheaper items require less capital, but usually offer worse profit. Some options may not be viable due to low buy limits or high capital requirements.

For the best efficiency, cast High Level Alchemy while doing other activities, such as questing, training Agility, melee combat, and farm runs. When alching items, place the items in the 4th row, all the way to the left, to eliminate the need to move the mouse.

Players can gain up to 78,000 experience per hour if standing still. When casting High Level Alchemy while doing other activities, players can expect much lower rates, anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 experience per hour.

Level 65+: Bake Pie
Completion of the quest Lunar Diplomacy is required to cast Bake Pie.

At level 65, players can train Cooking by baking pies using the Bake Pie spell on the Lunar spellbook. This offers relatively fast Cooking experience at a low amount of effort, and also a decent amount of passive Magic experience. However, this method is usually fairly expensive due to the low supply of uncooked pies, and some options may not be viable due to low trading volumes.

Players can gain up to 113,000 passive Magic experience per hour. For more information about the costs and Cooking experience rates, see Pay-to-play Cooking training.

Level 82+: Magic Imbue
Completion of the quest Lunar Diplomacy is required to cast Magic Imbue.

At level 82, players can cast Magic Imbue on the Lunar spellbook. It is mainly used when training Runecraft through crafting lava runes (or other combination runes), as casting the spell negates the need for talismans. If training Runecraft this way, players will gain a decent amount of passive Magic experience over time.

Similarly to High Level Alchemy, Magic Imbue can also be cast for the Magic experience alone while doing other activities. Magic Imbue only requires one click to cast and does not interrupt any actions, such as fishing. However, it can only be cast once every 21 ticks (12.6 seconds), costs money, and offers very slow experience by itself.

Players can gain up to around 20,000–24,000 passive Magic experience per hour. Casting the spell costs  per experience, assuming the player is wielding a steam battlestaff (or an equivalent combination, such as water battlestaff with a tome of fire or fire battlestaff with a tome of water).

Levels 62–99: Bursting/barraging on Ancient Magicks
After completing the Desert Treasure I quest, the player unlocks Ancient Magicks. The burst and barrage spells on this spellbook can be used to kill multiple monsters at once in multi-combat areas. This offers very fast experience, but can be somewhat expensive depending on the spell used and the monster killed.

The lowest-level burst spell, Smoke Burst, becomes available at level 62. Players may want to train with other methods until level 70, so they can use Ice Burst and wear better equipment (such as the occult necklace) for better damage output. Cast the highest-level multi-target spell for the best damage output. However, Smoke Burst remains a good cheaper alternative even at higher levels.

When bursting or barraging, use a weapon that can autocast Ancient Magicks. While this is not necessary, manually casting the spells adds a lot of extra effort and can become tedious over time. The kodai wand is the best weapon to use as it offers a 15% bonus in Magic damage, has a 15% chance of negating rune costs when casting offensive spells, and provides unlimited water runes. The nightmare staff is a good alternative as it also has the same Magic damage bonus, though it lacks the rune-saving effect and does not provide water runes. Another good alternative is the ancient sceptre (or its variants) as this provides a 5% Magic damage bonus, alongside a passive effect that increases the effects of Ancient Magicks by 10%. The Blue moon spear is a buyable alternative, boasting the same 5% Magic damage bonus, but missing the passive effect of the sceptre.  The Dragon Hunter Wand is another buyable alternative, providing 10% Magic damage bonus while allowing for autocasting Ancient Magicks. The ancient staff and the master wand do not provide any Magic damage bonus, so they are only recommended for short-term use.

Slayer

Many Slayer monsters can be killed with burst or barrage spells on task for fast Slayer experience. This is one of the most efficient ways to train Slayer and Magic, and it usually breaks even or profits.

Monsters that are commonly bursted or barraged on task include dust devils, Greater Nechryaels,  Warped Jellies, and smoke devils. If using alternative accounts to lure the monsters, it is also viable to kill abyssal demons, the TzHaar, and Mutated Bloodvelds.

For optimal training of Slayer, it is best to train Magic up to level 82 through the passive training methods above, and then use a saturated heart to boost to 94 for Ice Barrage. If the player does not have a saturated heart, the player should instead train to 94 via the passive methods. Ice Barrage is the highest-tier barrage spell, allowing for incredibly fast magic experience. However, since Slayer training generally offers a lot of passive Magic experience, players can start Slayer training even at level 70 Magic and use weaker spells until level 94 Magic. While this would be slightly slower overall, players would not have to put in the extra effort of passively training Magic while training other skills.

Killing Maniacal monkeys

Killing maniacal monkeys in Kruk's Dungeon is the fastest viable way to train Magic in real time. This requires having started Monkey Madness II until the part the player reaches Kruk's Dungeon. Maniacal monkeys spawn in very large numbers, have a long aggression range, and have very low Magic defence, making them ideal for bursting or barraging. This method costs money, and the exact cost depends on the player's equipment.

Use equipment that maximises Magic damage and Prayer bonuses. Having a higher max hit increases damage output a lot and makes casting effectively cheaper, as each cast would deal more damage for the same rune cost. Magic accuracy does not affect damage output much because the monkeys have low Magic defence, so prioritise Prayer bonus after Magic damage.

Having 2 alternative accounts to stack the monkeys is recommended should the player have access to them, as this makes this method fairly low-effort as well.

Experience rates vary depending on the exact method, equipment, and type of the spell used. With Ice Burst, players can gain up to around 310,000 experience per hour. With Ice Barrage, it is possible to gain up to around 400,000 experience per hour.

 Killing Zombie pirates 
Zombie pirates can be found in level 10-11 wilderness, near the chaos altar. As this is in the wilderness, players may attack you, however veteran players may find it fairly easy to escape (especially with Ice Burst and Barrage) due to the wilderness ditch being a short walk away. Regardless, it's recommended that the player doesn't risk any items they're not willing to lose. The player should use the Protect from Magic prayer while killing Zombie pirates as the chaos druids in the area are also plentiful and aggressive. Be wary that the chaos druids can teleblock you, which means the best escape from a PKer is usually to run south.

The Accursed sceptre (a) and Salve amulet(ei) are central to this strategy — The Accursed sceptre increases magic accuracy and damage by an additional 50% while attacking non-player characters in the wilderness. Similarly, the Salve amulet(ei) grants a 20% increase to the wearer's magic accuracy and magic damage when fighting undead monsters, like the Zombie pirate. Being in the wilderness, the player can also use Blighted ancient ice sack in order to cast Ice Burst or Ice Barrage. Although being in the wilderness comes with a risk, the Accursed sceptre and Salve amulet allow players to hit extremely high and kill the enemies quickly — even in low risk gear. There is an altar nearby for the player to restore their prayer, however it's recommended that the player brings 6-8 Blighted super restore as well as using the altar as the potions have a low cost and provide security and convenience.

In order to make this a worthwhile activity, the player must have completed the Medium Wilderness achievement diary; This increases the average value of Zombie pirate drops to . Before completion of the diary, the average drop value is . 

Players should bring a Looting bag, some blighted food, 1-2 Stamina potions, and 4-5 Saradomin brews in case of Player killers.

It's also recommended that the player has previously used the Teleport anchoring scroll, as this prevents the player from getting teleported around by the chaos druids that also attack. The scrolls effects are permanent.

Plugins on Runelite can help to mitigate risk and work so well they are, arguably, essential. The Wilderness Player Alarm plugin flashes the screen when a player is in view distance. The Player Indicators plugin can also make the PKers stand out more. Additionally, the player should enable "Skull prevention" in the ingame settings. The player can quite easily make decent money using this method.

Bandits (Bandit camp)
Killing bandits two tiles west from the door inside The Big Heist Lodge draws the aggression of all nearby bandits, automatically stacking them together for area of effect spells. This can be done as early as level 68 Magic, to cast Blood Burst or Blood Barrage. To do this it is needed to have a Saradomin or Zamorak item, a staff that can autocast ancient magicks, and a large supply of runes to cast with. It is recommended to wear items that boost magic damage and melee defence to kill bandits faster and reduce potential damage taken. Players can reach rates of 150,000 Magic experience per hour bursting or 230,000 Magic experience per hour barraging. The total experience per hour when defensive autocasting is up to 235,000 experience per hour bursting or 305,000 experience per hour barraging.

The life leech effect from blood spells outheals damage taken, making it unlikely to die here, unless Auto Retaliate disables after the 20 minute AFK timer. This method is particularly convenient to minimise gameplay inputs, similar to the method used with Guthan's within the Nightmare zone. This method can be quite expensive though, as bursting will cost  per hour and barraging will cost , and unlike the Slayer method will not recoup this from monster drops.

Other
For the players who have not started Monkey Madness II but have 65 Slayer, bursting dust devils in the Catacombs of Kourend is a cheap alternative to maniacal monkeys. They also have valuable drops which offset the cost of the runes.

For accounts with low Slayer level, bursting Temple Spiders in the eastern Forthos Dungeon is another option. You will need 43 prayer to Protect Melee or use blood spells to mitigate damage. These spiders drop a significant amount of herbs, seeds, alchables, various runes, and more, which can help pay for the expenses of prayer potions and runes.

In addition, those who have a fire cape can train on the TzHaar-Ket within the inner circle of Mor Ul Rek. This is a slower method, however it is still considerably faster than others, while also providing the opportunity to make a profit with the possible Obsidian armour and weapon drops. This is about equivalent experience to training on skeletal monkeys in the Ape Atoll Dungeon from Monkey Madness I.

Lunar spells
After completing the Lunar Diplomacy quest, the player unlocks the Lunar spellbook. Many of the spells offered by this spellbook can offer great experience, and some can process materials for gp while doing so.

Level 71+ Cure Me
Starting at level 71 Magic, or as early as level 65 with access to boosts, casting Cure Me from the Lunar spellbook can achieve up to 414,000 experience per hour optimally, costing  per hour, not including Prayer potions. Cure Me can be cast once every game tick (0.6 seconds), and the Araxytes in the Morytania Spider Cave are capable of continuously inflicting the player with Venom. Wear armour with the highest prayer bonus possible, such as sunfire fanatic armour, vestment robes, and ring of the gods (i). Bring prayer potions and a rune pouch containing astral, law, and cosmic runes to cast Cure Me with. Find a section of the cave without other players killing Araxytes, activate Protect from melee, and allow at least two Araxytes to attack you. Click on the Cure Me spell at least once every 0.6 seconds, which can be timed easily with either a metronome or by watching the XP drops in the corner. Spam clicking is not necessary and as the spell is limited in how fast it can be cast, so adjust the speed of clicks based on how often you receive the game message . Doing this method from level 71 Magic to level 99 would cost approximately  and take about 29.5 hours total.

After level 74 Magic, the spell Cure Group becomes available, which can be used in a similar manner to yield an additional 30,000 xp/hr compared to Cure Me, but costs  more per hour and requires a second account to be the one getting venomed. Cure Other is also possible with the use of a second account, but requires twice as many clicks and yields less xp per hour. It does cost significantly less to use, at only  per hour with the use of an earth staff or similar, assuming the same casting speed is maintained as Cure Me.

Level 81+ Potion share
Starting at level 81 Magic, or earlier with access to boosts, casting Stat Restore Pot Share from the Lunar spellbook can achieve up to around 140,000 experience per hour optimally, costing  per hour, assuming a Mud battlestaff or similar is used to save runes. This method also needs a second player, although it can be fairly easy to find players standing around Banks who can be used to cast this spell, though ensure only one player is within the 5x5 area of tiles around you as to not waste doses of Restore potion. Alternatively, only hold 1 dose potions to not have to worry about this, although xp/hr will be lower with more time spent banking.

After level 84 Magic, the spell Boost Potion Share becomes available, which can be used in a similar manner to yield an additional ~5,000 xp/hr compared to Stat Restore Pot Share, but costs  per hour instead. It is recommended to use Attack potions for this as they are very cheap.

Levels 80–99: String Jewellery
Casting String Jewellery on the Lunar spellbook requires relatively low amount of effort. The spell takes 1.8 seconds per amulet strung, or 48.6 seconds for an inventory, and gives 4 Crafting experience and 83 Magic experience per amulet. Once clicked, it will string each amulet one by one in the inventory, giving experience for each amulet strung. Using a mud battlestaff is recommended.

Players can gain up to 150,000 Magic (along with 6,265 Crafting) experience per hour.

Levels 86–99: Plank Make 
Completion of the quest Dream Mentor is required to cast Plank Make.

At level 86, players can auto-cast Plank Make on mahogany logs. This method will generate around 90,000 Magic experience per hour, which is around 1,000 casts, or less depending on banking speed, as well as generating a small amount of profit. Each inventory takes around 90 seconds, meaning it is a quite idle method of training. Alternatively, players can manually cast Plank Make on each log for around 166,000 Magic experience per hour. By casting Magic Imbue between every 7th manual cast of Plank Make, players can achieve over 180,000 Magic experience per hour. 

The only downside is that mahogany logs can be expensive to buy in bulk if starting with a low amount of money, and the spell is locked behind Dream Mentor. Managing Miscellania can be a way of accumulating mahogany logs at a discount, after completing Royal Trouble.

 Other methods 
Levels 7–99: Profitable methods
While it may be beneficial to find a consistent money maker and then train Magic with the faster but more expensive methods, it is possible to train magic without any loss. There is no way to profit up to level 7, so for new players interested in training Magic as soon as possible, it's suggested to do the Imp Catcher quest after obtaining the money for the beads from the Stronghold of Security.

Check the jewellery Calculator to ensure you are enchanting the most profitable item, and check the page of each spell to see the currently profitable items to use them on before buying anything. Some of these spells require additional quests or tasks to use; be sure that you can use a spell before buying materials for it, and that you know the mechanics of the spell itself before casting it not to waste materials.

Levels 55–80: Tele-alching
"Tele-alching" is a method which combines the two elements of casting High Level Alchemy and teleporting. To do this, cast High Level Alchemy followed by any teleport then wait 3 game ticks (1.8 seconds). Therefore, it is possible to perform a high alchemy and a teleport spell within 5 game ticks.  Utilizing "F" keys to manually swap back to the magic tab immediately after casting alchemy on an item, then quickly clicking a teleport spell will cause both the alchemy and teleport spell to be cast simultaneously, granting experience for both.  You will, however, only see the animation for the teleport spell.  This works best with High Alchemy and the Civitas Illia Fortis Teleport spells as they are located closely together and require less mouse movement between clicks, though it requires completion of Twilight's Promise.

Tele-alching at Camelot gives up to 144,600 experience per hour and is the cheapest requiring a single law rune per teleport. Tele-alching at Ardougne is at most 151,200 experience per hour, but is a lot more expensive at the cost of an extra law rune per teleport. Additionally, if you have completed Eadgar's Ruse, have fast enough speed and good enough precision, you may consider tele-alching at Trollheim at level 61. You can filter out Combat spells from the spellbook to minimise the distance between the High Level Alchemy spell and teleports such as Camelot Teleport.

Levels 80–99: Stun-alching
At level 80 Magic, Stun-alching becomes available, but does cost much more than high alchemy which is generally profitable or free. The player is to cast High Alchemy, then cast Stun on an NPC, and repeat until desired. For this, you'll want a mud battlestaff (provides free earth/water runes) and a set of metal armour such as iron (full helm, platebody, platelegs, kiteshield) and a d'hide vambrace to bring your magic attack bonus to -65 or lower, this will allow you to splash your stun spell and continually cast it on the same target without needing to wait for their stats to restore, then find a suitable NPC to safespot. A good spot is the basement of the Magic Guild in Yanille. Equip a granite helm, granite legs, and a fighter torso as needed to keep your attack bonus below -65 with a tome of fire and mud staff equipped. Experience rates of 184,000 per hour are possible.

It is possible to add in a teleport to this rotation without missing any game ticks. Using Ardougne Teleport as your choice keeps you within the range of a guard at all times to stun, and with this experience rates of up to 256,000 per hour are possible. This method is immensely click intensive, so it may not be desirable.

===== Free-to-play Magic training =====
Magic is a useful skill in RuneScape, and especially in free to play, because there is no access to magic tablets, so many teleports are only available by leveling Magic.

Equipment choice
 

Before you begin training 
Before you can begin training Magic, you'll need what every great mage requires: runes! Every spell requires at least one type of rune, and many spells require three and sometimes even four different types of runes to cast.

At level 1 Magic, you'll only be able to cast Wind Strike, which requires one air rune and one mind rune. With a staff of air equipped, you have access to unlimited air runes, so that you don't need air runes. There are staves for every basic type of rune; these staves are referred to as elemental staves, and will help assist in training Magic and give you unlimited runes for that element.

Quests
Some quests give Magic experience on completion:

 Imp Catcher rewards 875 Magic experience
 Witch's Potion rewards 325 Magic experience

Together, these quests are enough experience to raise from level 1 Magic to level 10 Magic before casting any spells. This means your Wind Strike's maximum hit will start at 6.

Obtaining runes
There are a few ways in which you can get your hands on runes. Each method has its perks, though some methods will make gathering them faster.

Buying from a shop or the Grand Exchange
Certain free-to-play runes can be bought from shops such as Aubury's Rune Shop (individually or as item packs), and all free-to-play runes can be purchased from other players on the Grand Exchange. The advantage in this method is that you can generally obtain a large stock of runes much faster than you could by crafting them, though buying runes generally results in spending more gold, and needing more gold to begin training.

The following table can be consulted for store and Grand Exchange prices of free-to-play runes:

TypeGE PriceStore Price (or  from air rune packs) (or  from water rune packs) (or  from earth rune packs) (or  from fire rune packs) (or  from mind rune packs) (or  from chaos rune packs)N/AN/AN/A

Crafting runes
You may choose to craft your own runes through Runecraft at any of the various runic altars, which is possibly the fastest way aside from buying from another player or from one of the magic shops. The downside is that free-to-play players cannot craft cosmic, nature, law, chaos, or death runes. 

Crafting runes requires rune essence or pure essence, and either a talisman or tiara that is compatible with the specific altar (for example, you may not use a fire talisman or fire tiara on the Air Altar to gain entry into the Air Altar and create air runes, instead you would need an air talisman or air tiara). For more details on methods of effectively crafting runes, see the Free-to-play Runecraft training article.

Killing monsters
Level 7 dark wizards found at the Varrock stone circle have some of the best drop rates for runes of any monster in free-to-play, only falling short of much higher level monsters such as ogress warriors and shamans. They drop all free-to-play rune types with the exception of death runes, and given their low Hitpoints and max hit combined with their vulnerability to all attack styles, one can obtain quite a large stockpile of runes fairly quickly. It is however recommended to have at least combat level 41 to avoid aggression from the much more dangerous Level 20 dark wizards nearby. 

For those with a lower combat level, Level 9 wizards found at the Wizards' Tower offer similar rune drop rates, but with lower quantities and lacking cosmic runes. They also have a higher max hit and slightly more Hitpoints. 

Some higher level monsters such as hobgoblins, hill giants, moss giants, and ice giants also drop a variety of runes, but at much lower drop rates and/or quantities. Their higher levels also mean that drops won't be obtained anywhere near as quickly as with dark wizards or wizards.

How to train Magic efficiently
Level 1–17
It's highly recommended to use a staff if possible, because you can cast much more easily by going into combat options, clicking on the spell button, and choosing the spell you wish to autocast, instead of manually clicking the spell each time.

The following equipment is useful for training Magic:

Amulet of magic
Blue wizard robe
Zamorak monk bottom 
Wizard hat

Casting Wind Strike on the cows around Lumbridge is a good way to get a few levels quickly, and also profit from the cowhides that they drop. You can either sell the hides, or tan them at Ellis, the tanner in Al Kharid, and then sell for even more profit, or even use the leather that you obtain from tanning for use in the Crafting skill. A few shrimps or jugs of wine is all you need for healing while you kill cows and collect cowhides. As you level, you will gain access to more spells like Water Strike at level 5, Earth Strike at level 9, and Fire Strike at level 13, which you can use instead of Wind Strike to maximise experience gains.

Alternatively, you can choose to kill something else with a similar combat level, such as goblins, chickens, rats, spiders, or ducks.

It's also possible to cast non-offensive spells that do not give Hitpoints experience, like confuse or curse, depending on what sort of account you wish to build.

Level 17+
At level 17, you can begin using Wind Bolt, increasing the amount of damage you can do, and may use stronger bolt spells at their respective levels.

Options for further training include:
Hill Giants in Edgeville Dungeon which drop big bones and limpwurt roots, and can be attacked from safespots.
The lesser demon in Wizards' Tower which drops runes and other valuables. Note: Telekinetic Grab is required to collect the drops.
Al Kharid warriors in Al Kharid (usually crowded).
Hobgoblins in Edgeville Dungeon are also an option which drop limpwurt roots and has a few safespots.
There are three level 21 skeletons in Varrock Sewers; the player can attack them from a safe location on one side of the water.

Level 33+
At level 33, you can begin using Telekinetic Grab, allowing you to profit whilst training Magic and opens lots of options for Magic combat and passive training.
Hobgoblins can be safespotted from the cow field behind the crafting guild. 
Telegrab the limpwurt roots and nature runes. 
Do take note that most of the time your character will try to go around, though.
Wine of Zamorak from the Chaos Temple in Asgarnia (recommended) or the Chaos Temple (hut) in the Wilderness.
Recommended Method: 
If telegrabbing the wine from the  , bring wizard's mind bombs to restore your stats as taking the wine will inflict damage and stat-draining effects on you. If your Magic level is drained below 33, you will not be able to cast Telekinetic Grab.
If telegrabbing the wine from the  the monks will become aggressive to the caster. However, should you leave the temple, they will not be able to step outside the temple to pursue you.
You can use this to your advantage to train your Magic further by bringing either Mind runes or Chaos runes to cast Wind Strike / Wind Bolt; as the monks have a chance to drop Zamorak monk bottoms, this can increase your profit further.
Alternately, if you have a total level of 500 and are wearing Zamorak monk robes, you can climb the ladder to the , where there is a second Wine of Zamorak on the table which does not inflict damage or stat drains if telegrabbed.

 Nature runes in the Wilderness, south-east of the Demonic Ruins. (Do not take anything that you cannot replace / are not willing to lose.) 
 Recommended Method: 
 Take 200 law runes, 200 earth runes, 200 water runes, 200 Chaos runes, 2 nature runes, and fill the rest of inventory with jugs of wine, wield air staff and set Wind Bolt as your auto-attack spell
 Wear a Blue wizard hat, a Blue wizard robe, a Zamorak monk bottom, an Amulet of magic and either a Wooden shield, Training shield or anti-dragon shield. 
 Telegrab both piles of nature runes from the small peninsula, then switch worlds. 
 If you are attacked by a player, cast Bind, then Earth Bolt, (have wind bolt as your auto attack), then fight or run away and drink wines as needed.

The Greater demons in the Wilderness located near the Demonic Ruins can be safe-spotted from near the nature rune spawn. (Do not take anything that you cannot replace / are not willing to lose.) 
Greater Demons drop several Rune and Adamant items, which can prove to be extremely profitable. 
Recommended Method: similar to the one above for nature runes, but bring an additional 2000+ mind runes and set wind strike as your auto attack spell.)
The caged Lesser demon in the Wizards' Tower.
In addition to Vile ashes which can be sold or used for Prayer training, lesser demons drop a variety of high value items, including uncut gems.
Coins / Gold bars / Gold ores / Gold necklaces beneath the bank in west Varrock. 
For players buying runes on the Grand Exchange, this is the easiest method for generating a profit from magic training until Level 55, as the Gold necklaces can be sold for more than the cost of the runes used for casting.
Players can either grab all the items for the fastest exp, or only grab the Gold Ore for the most profit. 
Switching Worlds is recommended to avoid waiting out the long respawn time of the items in the vault.

Level 59+
At level 59, you can begin using Fire Blast, while being the strongest available spell in free-to-play, you can also benefit of the elemental weakness of ice giants and ice warriors in the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon for a max hit of 32, averaging approximately 70k magic experience per hour at maximum efficiency. They also can be safespotted, so no food is needed and can be trained without interruption. High alchemy can also be cast in between Fire Blast for an extra 78k Magic XP per hour, making it a maximum of 148k Magic XP per hour.

If you need to save elemental runes, you can alternately use Wind Blast with a staff of air, which grants less base XP than Fire Blast but its magic damage scales to the damage of Fire Blast at level 59. Ghosts and skeletons have elemental weakness to wind spells, with ghosts taking 50% extra damage and skeletons taking 35% extra damage. High-level ghosts and skeletons can be found in level 4 (Sepulchre of Death) of the Stronghold of Security.

Other monsters to kill for experience
The following are alternative monsters to train Magic on for experience and drops.
Moss giants can be effective for gaining Magic experience, as they have a 50% weakness to fire. They also drop big bones for passive Prayer experience, as well as the unique mossy keys used to access Bryophyta. They can be safespot in Varrock Sewers (bring a slash weapon or knife), or on Crandor for those who have completed Dragon Slayer I. Until combat level 85 moss giants are aggressive and have a max hit of 6; however, they can still be killed safely from safespots without much risk. Like most monsters, they will become tolerant when training in the same area longer than 10 minutes, which makes collecting drops between kills completely safe.
Ankou in Stronghold of Security are another popular option for training magic, and they can be safespotted behind skeleton remains in the south-west room of the Sepulchre of Death floor. Skull sceptre (i) is recommended to autocast Crumble Undead but runes will not be saved. Fortunately, Crumble Undead's cost is cheap compared to Earth Blast that does the same maximum damage of 15, making it a cheap magic training method in combat.
Ogress warriors are also good for good money and experience, although they have high magic and range defence so 60+ Magic is recommended. Blast spells are recommended for faster kills as the runes and using High Level Alchemy on the rune equipment that ogresses drop can make some of the cost back.
 There are lesser demons on Karamja under the volcano with safespots. They have a 40% weakness to water and drop vile ashes which makes them a viable option to train both Prayer and Magic.
 Other options include flesh crawlers, spiders, giant spiders, guards, and body golems (in the Ruins of Camdozaal).

Alternative training methods
 Cheap methods
Splashing Wind Strike
Splashing Wind Strike with -55 Magic attack bonus (full metal armour and a staff of air) costs 2 coins for 6 xp at 7200 xp per hour, although it will eventually kill most targets until -64 or lower Magic attack bonus is obtained. See AFK training methods.

Splashing Curse
Starting at level 19, one could repeatedly splash Curse to gain Magic experience. Casting curse yields 29 experience; approximately 34,000 experience per hour, and a gp/xp of  when using a staff of earth.

Note: if Curse lands on an enemy, it cannot be cast again on that enemy until the effects wear off. Splashing bypasses this timer, as the spell never landed on the enemy in the first place.

Recommended equipment:

Staff of earth with armour that provides negative magic bonuses.
Iron armour or Green dragonhide armour
Fighting/Fancy boots are good choices.
A magic bonus of -65 attack or lower is strongly recommended.

Some monster options for this type of training include:

Skeletons
Ducks
The monk of Zamorak in Varrock Palace (Which will allow you to cast curse again after a few seconds, even if you don't splash)
The bear north of Varrock Castle, near the yew trees
The lesser demon on the top floor of the Wizards' Tower.

The locations above are often in use, so it could be worthwhile finding somewhere else that works best for you.

 Low level Alchemy method 
At level 21 Magic you can cast Low Level Alchemy on Iron platebodies for 31 magic experience per cast. At grand exchange prices, each cast nets . You will need 5214 casts to go from level 21 to level 55, which will take 7 days to buy off the grand exchange with the Grand Exchange#Buy limits for platebodies.

Superheating iron ore method

At level 43 Magic and 15 smithing you can cast Superheat Item on Iron Ore for 53 magic experience per cast. This can be potentially profitable if you sell the iron bars. At 3 ticks per cast you can theoretically smelt 2,000 iron ore per hour for a total of 106,000 experience per hour, though actual experience will be lower from using the bank.

High level Alchemy method
At level 55 Magic you can cast High Level Alchemy on various items for 65 magic experience per cast, achieving at most 78,000 experience per hour with nonstop alching. Items that are consistently profitable include green d'hide bodies, mithril platebodies, adamant equipment, rune equipment, and more. Players can always make a profit when high alching by checking a spreadsheet or Grand Exchange Market Watch/Alchemy to see which items currently offer a profit. Keep in mind that some items have a more restrictive limit as to how many you can buy per 4 hours when purchasing them from the Grand Exchange. If you are not an ironman, world 308 is the unofficial high alchemy trading world, where players frequently buy and sell high quantities of profitable high alchemy items directly to one another in the Varrock west bank.

Enchanting amulets
From level 7 onwards, amulets can be enchanted using enchantment spells, a click intensive training method which gives great experience per hour rates and can also generate profit. By manually clicking the spell and each amulet in the player's inventory, an amulet can be enchanted every 3 ticks, whereas a player using the spell on an amulet once and waiting will automatically enchant all amulets in their inventory much slower, at a rate of one every 7 ticks. When manually clicking, around 1885 or more amulets can be enchanted every hour. Elemental staves can be used to decrease cost when enchanting.

Alternatively, you can also purchase unstrung (u) amulets and balls of wool and string the amulets yourself.  This is quite fast, has no level or material requirements, provides a little bit of  EXP, is often profitable, and can help if the GE market for (strung) amulets is unfavourable.

Expensive methods

Teleporting 
Casting teleport spells can be a good way to gain some experience, though it can quickly become expensive. If you do choose this method, start with Varrock Teleport at level 25, move on to Lumbridge Teleport at level 31, and then cast Falador Teleport at level 37. A staff of air is recommended as these teleports all require 3 air runes each cast.

Teleport alchemy 
Another method involves alchemy and teleportation. To do this method, you will need to cast high alchemy on an item, teleport immediately afterwards, click the high alchemy spell while you are waiting to arrive in the teleport location, and then click the item again as soon as you arrive. This makes sure that you do not lose any potential experience. The recommended teleport location is Falador.  Falador teleport gives the most experience of any free to play teleport spells.

AFK methods

Splashing
-64 or lower Magic attack bonus will allow for you to splash these spells for approximately 20 minutes while being AFK. This method is 100% safe for HCIM at certain locations such as the top floor of the wizards tower.

===== Pay-to-play Runecraft training =====
This guide describes the most effective methods to train the Runecraft skill. 

General information and tips
Most Runecraft training methods involve using essence. Pure essence is most commonly used, as it can be used for all rune types and is typically cheaper than rune essence.

The Raiments of the Eye set grants 60% more runes when the full outfit is worn, though no extra experience is given. The outfit can be obtained through the Guardians of the Rift minigame. Getting the outfit is recommended if the player plans to train with profitable methods.

Drinking stamina potions is generally the best option for restoring run energy. The ring of endurance is also useful, as it reduces the run energy drain and doubles the duration of the stamina potion effect when charged. 

Recommended quests
The quests listed in the table below offer very useful rewards for a lot of training methods. Completing them is strongly recommended before doing a lot of Runecraft training.

The quest also awards 5,000 Runecraft experience.
NPC Contact can be used to quickly repair essence pouches. Casting this spell requires level 67 Magic.
Ourania Teleport provides a very fast access to the Ourania Altar. Casting this spell requires level 71 Magic.
Magic Imbue negates the need for a talisman when crafting combination runes. Casting this spell requires level 82 Magic.

Essence pouches
right|thumb|120px|The large pouch.
Essence pouches can be filled with essence and then emptied to add the essence back into the player's inventory. This allows the player to carry more essence per run, which will increase experience rates in most cases. A small pouch is given to the player after completing Enter the Abyss. A medium pouch is awarded after completing Temple of the Eye.

To fill an essence pouch, simply click on it while having essence in the inventory. The pouches can be filled without closing the bank interface. A filled essence pouch can be emptied by holding the Shift key and then clicking on the pouch. To enable the Shift-click empty configuration, toggle on 'Shift click to drop items' through settings.

Essence pouches are dropped by abyssal leeches, guardians, and walkers. They reside in the Abyss and in the Abyssal Area. The Abyss can be accessed through the Mage of Zamorak in level 5 Wilderness north of Edgeville, and the Abyssal Area through the fairy ring . The pouches are dropped in increasing size; a player who already has the small pouch will get a medium pouch next, and so on. The pouches can be obtained prior to having the required Runecraft levels to use them. However, players cannot store any essence inside of them without the Runecraft level requirement.

The colossal pouch is made by using an abyssal needle to stitch together a small, medium, large, and giant pouch. This requires unboosted levels of 25 Runecraft and 56 Crafting.

The pouches above small degrade after enough use. When degraded, they will hold less essence than they normally would. To repair the pouches, talk to the Dark mage in the Abyss or via NPC Contact. The player can alternatively have Apprentice Cordelia repair the pouches for 1 abyssal pearl after unlocking the service for 25 abyssal pearls. Repair the pouches right before they become degraded or as soon as they do. If the pouches are not repaired, they will eventually vanish after enough use, in which case the player will have to get new ones. The small pouch can be obtained from the Dark mage for free if lost.

Rune pouch

The rune pouch (not to be confused with essence pouches) can store 16,000 of three types of runes. It saves inventory space for methods where runes are used for casting spells, such as NPC Contact for repairing essence pouches. This will increase experience rates for those methods. To get a rune pouch, buy a rune pouch note from the Grand Exchange and use it on a banker in exchange for a rune pouch. A rune pouch note currently costs .

Players who have completed Sins of the Father can obtain untradeable daeyalt essence through mining daeyalt shards. Mining the shards requires level 60 Mining. Daeyalt essence can be used and stored in essence pouches like pure essence, but provides a 50% bonus to Runecraft experience when used. The experience bonuses of daeyalt essence and Ourania Altar stack multiplicatively for a total of 255%. Like with pure essence, the daeyalt essence cannot be used in place of dark essence fragments to craft blood or soul runes at the Kourend altars.

Obtaining and using daeyalt essence is slower overall than buying pure essence from the Grand Exchange and using it. The efficiency can be calculated using this formula:

Where  is Essence used per hour and  is shards mined per hour.

Example:

Someone uses up 2538 essence per hour at the Ourania Altar, and they mine about 4400 Shards at daeyalt essence mine per hour.

This results in  or   efficiency. That means, in this example, spending the time to mine daeyalt essence and then crafting it, yields  of the experience you would get if you were to craft runes using bought pure essence instead. 

While the efficiency is below 100% most of the time, it is still a low-effort alternative to training Runecraft. Since you can spend one third of your training time AFK Mining, then only two thirds of the time actively running the essence to any altar while still getting (for example) 95% of the experience you would normally get. There is also little variance in daeyalt mining opposed to the fast clicks and quick banking required to Runecraft. If you can be 95% efficient mining Daeyalt, but only 75% efficient runecrafting, daeyalt will benefit your gameplay style, and may be more efficient overall. Maximum theoretical efficiency of mining shards with a dragon pickaxe is 4856 an hour.

Starting off
Levels 1–32/34: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Runecraft experience. Completing Enter the Abyss miniquest, The Ascent of Arceuus, The Eyes of Glouphrie, Temple of the Eye and The Slug Menace grants a total of 20,210 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 33. This allows the player to craft lava runes right from the start or do the Guardians of the Rift minigame. All these quests have low requirements and can be done at a fairly low level.

Lunar Diplomacy grants an additional 5,000 experience, which will get the player to level 36, but it has much higher requirements. However, being on the lunar spellbook is highly recommended for crafting lava runes and for Ourania Altar.

Levels 1–50: Making talisman tiaras

Making talisman tiaras is one of the fastest training methods up to level 50. It also has no quest or skill level requirements. This method is fairly click-intensive and can be very expensive depending on the talisman prices, so it is only recommended for players who wish to get through the early levels as fast as possible and do not mind spending some money. Crafting lava runes offers faster experience rates from level 50 onwards. Players who are looking for a lower-effort alternative to making talisman tiaras or crafting lava runes are advised to complete quests to skip the early levels and do the Guardians of the Rift minigame.

Talisman tiaras are made by using a talisman on the corresponding altar with a tiara in the inventory. The tiara can be also used on the altar, but the left-click option on tiaras is wear, so it is suggested to use the talisman instead. Wearing a tiara also makes the altar left-click and removes an animation on getting into the altar.

The ring of the elements is required for the fastest rates, as it provides fast teleports to all the elemental runic altars. Using an amulet of glory is recommended for fast banking, as equipping it allows the player to make 14 tiaras per inventory. A ring of dueling can alternatively be used for fast access to the altar and to the bank if making tiaras at the Fire Altar.

The experience rates assume 1,450 tiaras made per hour. With accurate clicks and good banking, it is possible to make up to around 1,550 tiaras per hour. The profit rates assume using a ring of the elements to get to the altar and the amulet of glory for banking. Elemental tiaras may not be viable due to low trading volumes.

Levels 23–99: Lava runes

Crafting lava runes is the fastest way to train Runecraft. They are made by visiting the Fire Altar with essence and at least an equal amount of earth runes. Having a binding necklace equipped ensures combination runes are crafted 100% of the time.

For the fastest rates, players will need level 82 Magic and completion of Lunar Diplomacy to cast the spell Magic Imbue. It negates the need for a talisman in combination runecrafting, which will increase experience rates. Players who cannot use the spell will need to use earth talismans instead.

Solo lavas

An optimal setup consists of the following:
 A fire or elemental tiara to enter the Fire Altar. An attuned hat of the eye may be used as well.
 A binding necklace to consistently craft combination runes.
 A mist battlestaff and a tome of fire (or smoke battlestaff and a tome of water) for unlimited air, water, and fire runes.
 A Crafting cape or a ring of dueling for banking. Using Menu Entry Swaps allows for left-click teleports without removing your cape or ring.
 Ring of the elements (if using the Crafting cape) or a ring of dueling to get to the Fire Altar.
 Weight-reducing clothing (optional).
 A large stack of earth runes for crafting combination runes, used on the altar to craft the combination runes.
 A rune pouch to bring astral and cosmic runes for NPC Contact and Magic Imbue.
 Essence pouches for bringing extra pure essence: with 75+ Runecraft, the giant and large pouch; without 75 Runecraft, all pouches available.
 Pure essence for the rest of the inventory.
 RuneLite with Menu Entry Swapper for instant click teleports, fills, and emptying.

The ring of the elements spawns the player one tile closer to the altar than the ring of dueling on average, though as the player moves two tiles at a time this does not always save time. The ring of the elements carries more charges than the ring of dueling, making banking easier.

The player may want to only use the two largest essence pouches available. The time saved filling and emptying the pouches could result in faster laps and better experience rates, as well allowing the dueling ring and binding necklaces to discharge evenly. If using essence pouches without Magic Imbue, bring another earth talisman as the runes in the pouches would not be made into lava runes. 

Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates vary depending on performance and how many essence pouches are available. Before level 99, players can gain up to 93,000 experience per hour at maximum efficiency. Due to the click-intensive process this method involves, players may be more likely to see rates closer to 85,000–90,000 experience per hour. At level 99, the maximum possible experience rate caps at around 98,000 experience per hour.

Using lava runners
Crafting lava runes using essence runners is the fastest method to train Runecraft. This method is very expensive, so it is only recommended for wealthy players who wish to gain experience as fast as possible and do not mind spending a lot of money. It also requires good coordination and accurate clicks, as the player will need to rapidly accept trades and craft runes at the altar.

Essence running services have a considerable potential of having connections with real-world trading. Use caution and be selective when arranging essence running, as exchanging gold for an in-game service with real-world traders will risk the account getting permanently banned.

The fastest method is to have four runners run the essence while the runecrafter stands at the altar. Having two to three runners is only recommended for inexperienced runecrafters who are learning the method.

Alternatively, craft lava runes normally (as a solo player) and have 1 runner trade extra essence every lap. This method is also known as duo or 1+1 lavas. This method is slower than using 4 runners, but also cheaper.

A runner typically costs around 12-15 million coins per hour. The price can vary depending on the runner's experience.

Experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The costs assume the player is paying 12 million coins per hour per runner. The rates can also vary depending on how well the runecrafter and the runners perform. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to around 320,000 experience per hour.

Levels 27–99: Guardians of the Rift

The Guardians of the Rift minigame is an alternative way of training Runecraft. In addition to Runecraft experience, the minigame also offers passive Mining and Crafting experience. The minigame is profitable and offers useful rewards, such as the colossal pouch for holding more essence and Raiments of the Eye set for crafting extra runes.

To participate in the minigame, players must have completed Temple of the Eye. The experience gained from completing the quest is enough to get the player from level 10 to 27, which is required for the minigame. There are also a number of quests that are very useful to have completed, which are listed below.

Lunar Diplomacy to be able to cast NPC Contact to quickly repair essence pouches
Lost City to craft cosmic runes
Troll Stronghold to craft law runes
Mourning's End Part II to craft death runes
Sins of the Father to craft blood runes

Use the best pickaxe and all essence pouches available. The rune pouch is strongly recommended to save inventory space. Players who do not have the Raiments of the Eye outfit yet are advised to wear any tier of the Varrock armour to have a 10% chance to mine double guardian fragments at once. Players may also make use of the celestial ring if they have it.

Players who have the abyssal lantern should light it with redwood logs if possible. This makes it so the player does not need to repair essence pouches via NPC Contact, which saves 1–3 inventory slots, depending on if the player is using a rune pouch. Players who cannot use redwood logs or are wearing the Runecraft cape are advised to use yew logs for the point boost it provides. Also note that if the player is using combination rune strategies, redwood logs do not save any inventory space if steam runes are used to cast magic imbue, so yew logs are recommended.

Through Guardians of the Rift players can obtain the Raiments of the Eye set. It provides 10% more runes per piece worn and an additional 20% set bonus, for a total of 60% when wearing a full set. The abyssal needle is used to combine essence pouches into the colossal pouch. It can hold up to 40 essence, making it the best essence pouch to use. Valuable runes obtained through the minigame can be kept for later use or sold on the Grand Exchange for profit.

The experience rates in the table below assume using the best pouch(es) available. From level 85 onwards, the rates assume doing the minigame in small, coordinated teams for faster experience.

Levels 1–99: Ourania Altar
Crafting runes at the Ourania Altar (also known as the ZMI Altar) is a profitable lower-effort alternative to lava runes. The altar can be accessed at any Runecraft level. Unlike the other runic altars, the Ourania Altar converts essence into a random assortment of runes, which improves in cash and experience value as the player levels Runecraft.

For this method, players will need to have unlocked the Ourania Teleport on the Lunar spellbook for a fast access to the altar. This requires completion of Lunar Diplomacy and speaking to Baba Yaga while on the Lunar spellbook. Being on the Lunar spellbook is also needed for casting NPC Contact to quickly repair essence pouches. Having level 71 Magic is strongly recommended to be able to cast both of these spells.

Having the rune pouch is strongly recommended to have more inventory space for the essence. The medium Ardougne Diary reward increases the amount of runes that are crafted, however no experience is given for the extra runes.

The official worlds for the Ourania Altar are Worlds 327 and 480. Use one of these worlds to have a lower chance of being targeted by the monsters, as the world will often be filled with other players training Runecraft. Alternatively, two alternate accounts can be used to lure the monsters so that they do not hit the player; this also allows training another skill such as Fletching whilst running to the altar for greater macro-efficiency.

Experience rates are shown in the table below, and assume players have all of the essence pouches available at each level. The rates and the experience per essence scale depending on the Runecraft level. At higher levels, the player can expect to make somewhere around 350,000–400,000 coins per hour depending on the rune prices.

Setup
To quickly access the bank, players need to pay 20 of any kind of rune (excluding combination runes) by setting a quick-payment deal with Eniola. Mind or elemental runes are usually the cheapest option. Clear the rune pouch and essence pouch space holders, and fill the entire bank with bank fillers (or use the bank's 'Deposit Lock Settings'). This way, the player can quickly deposit all the crafted runes without depositing any necessary items. Have essence, 1-dose stamina potions, and cosmic runes near the 'Deposit inventory' button for efficient banking.

The optimal setup consists of the following:
All essence pouches available
Dust battlestaff (or a staff of earth and air runes) for casting Ourania Teleport and NPC Contact
Rune pouch holding payment, astral, and law runes. Bring cosmic runes as well if using the divine rune pouch.
Some defensive equipment (not needed if using alternative accounts to lure the monsters)
Raiments of the Eye set for extra profit (optional but recommended)
Ring of endurance with at least 500 charges (optional)

Players who find that they are taking a lot of damage can wear the Hitpoints cape along with a regen bracelet. This will most likely outheal any damage taken. Lower-level players are advised to bring more defensive equipment (such as wearing a black d'hide body and a helm of neitiznot) and use cheap food to heal themselves if needed. A ring of suffering (i) can be considered as an alternative to the ring of endurance if greater defensive bonuses are desired, or the Steel ring/Granite ring (i) if the suffering is too expensive.

Players who do not have level 71 Magic to cast Ourania Teleport can use the respective teleport tablets instead, though this will require an extra inventory slot.

At level 75 Runecraft and higher, players may opt to replace law runes in the rune pouch with cosmic runes. This removes the need to withdraw cosmic runes for casting NPC Contact, and at higher levels it is very unlikely that the player will not craft any law runes at the altar. Players with the divine rune pouch can bring cosmic runes without this consideration.

The inventory and gear setup provided assumes using Lunar spellbook with 96 Magic to cast Spellbook Swap to Arceuus spellbook and cast Vile Vigour for run energy as needed (otherwise utilize stamina potions). Mind runes should be set up to be used as default when banking with Eniola.

Runecrafting and tips
Starting at the bank, run to the altar using the shorter route by running south and then east. Craft runes at the altar until you have run out of essence. Cast Ourania Teleport, run south-west to the ladder and climb down, and bank at Eniola. Drink a stamina potion dose to restore run energy whenever needed.

Turn off Auto Retaliate and set NPC 'Attack' options to 'Hidden' to avoid attacking and retaliating against the monsters. Turning the camera south allows for easy vision while running to the ladder and throughout the cave.

Instead of using stamina potions, players can restore run energy by casting Spellbook Swap to use Vile Vigour from the Arceuus spellbook. This method requires level 96 Magic and completion of A Kingdom Divided. Restore prayer points at the altar next to the Ourania Cave entrance.  Casting Spellbook Swap or Vile Vigour does not interrupt running, so it is best to cast the spells while running to the ladder leading to the cave.

Having the divine rune pouch allows the player to store soul, cosmic, astral and payment runes in one inventory spot. The player can use the law rune acquired from runecrafting at the altar to cast Ourania Teleport. Alternatively, players can store aether, law, astral and payment runes. This will remove the small chance of not creating a law rune at the altar.

If there are multiple players training Runecraft in the same world, the player can get to the altar with less effort by trading or using an item on other players running to the altar, provided that they do not stop at all. Following other players (instead of trading or using an item on them) is not recommended, as players can get stuck behind walls if there is enough distance between them. Using the increased draw distance of approved, non-standard clients such as RuneLite, it is possible to one-click from the cave entrance to the altar. This removes the need to follow others or click multiple times along the path.

Levels 77–99: Crafting blood/soul runes in Arceuus

Crafting blood or soul runes in Arceuus is a profitable low-effort alternative to the faster training methods. This method also provides passive Mining and Crafting experience. Blood runes can be crafted at level 77 and soul runes at level 90.

Crafting runes in Arceuus requires level 38 Mining, level 38 Crafting, a chisel, and a pickaxe. The pickaxe tier does not matter, so use the black pickaxe or the lightest one available. A chisel spawns at the runestone mine. Having a high Agility level (78+) is recommended for faster run energy restoration, and a ring of endurance with at least 500 charges for reduced run energy consumption. Level 73 Agility is required for the western rock scramble shortcut. The medium Kourend & Kebos Diary reward grants the player a 5% chance to mine two dense essence blocks at once (no Mining or Crafting experience is given for the extra block), which will increase experience rates slightly.

Starting at the Arceuus essence mine, this method goes as follows:
 Mine a full inventory of dense essence blocks.
 Use them on the Dark Altar to create dark essence blocks. 
 Chisel the dark essence blocks into fragments while running back to the mine. 
 Mine a second inventory of essence blocks, and use them on the Dark Altar. 
 Chisel 1 dark essence block into fragments.
 Head to the runic altar and craft runes.
 Chisel the second inventory of dark essence blocks into fragments. 
 Craft runes once more and return to the essence mine.

The experience and profit rates in the table below assume completion of the medium Kourend & Kebos Diary and running to the altar. Expect lower rates if idling.

More information and tips

While using the Abyss can be slightly faster than running to the altar, doing so is generally not recommended because of the extra effort and risk involved. Players using the Abyss are advised to bank the runes every so often to reduce the risk to a potential player killer. To craft blood or soul runes via the Abyss, players must craft runes at the respective altar before using a dark essence block on the rift to unlock it.

Players who have completed the elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary and have a revitalisation pool and fairy ring in their player-owned house can alternatively use Teleport to house to make the procedure slightly faster and remove the need for the graceful outfit. A construction cape or rune pouch with law, dust, and an empty spot for the crafted runes will allow for no lost inventory slots. If on Arceuus spellbook, you can use Home teleport every half hour, which teleports you next to the altar.
 For blood runecrafting, after making a second inventory of dark essence blocks teleport to your house, restore run energy with the pool, use the fairy ring  and run to the altar.
 For soul runecrafting, after crafting runes at the altar teleport to your house, restore run energy with the pool, use the fairy ring  and return to the essence mine.

The chance for a runestone not to deplete scales with the Mining level. The Mining level thresholds and the expected depletion times are shown in the table below. The dragon pickaxe special attack can be used to boost the Mining level to the next threshold. Otherwise the pickaxe type does not matter, as blocks are mined every 9 ticks.

Other methods
Levels 1–99: Arceuus Library
Helping customers in the Arceuus Library is a viable Runecraft training method that has no requirements. To do this, talk to Villia or Professor Gracklebone to have them request a book. Ask Biblia on the top floor for a hint on where the requested book is, fetch the book, and give it to the customer. The customer will give a book of arcane knowledge in return. Read it and use option 2 for Runecraft experience, and continue by helping the other customer. Sam is further away from the book locations, so only fetch books for Villia or Professor Gracklebone.

Each book of arcane knowledge gives Runecraft experience equal to 5x the player's Runecraft level. Because of this linear scaling, it is strongly recommended to complete quests that give Runecraft experience to get past the initial slow experience. With good performance, players can turn in around 150–160 books per hour when using third party client features to find the books faster, however without them players can only turn in 90–100 books per hour.

Experience rates are shown in the table below. Use the Arceuus Library Books Calculator to determine how many books are needed to reach a target level or experience.

Levels 15–99: Other combination runes

Crafting other combination runes can be a profitable alternative to lava runes. Because of somewhat low trading volumes, the runes may take long to sell at a good profit.

Mud runes can be crafted at level 13. Use water runes on the Earth Altar and the ring of the elements to get there.

Levels 50-99: Imbuing desiccated pages
Fighting the Royal Titans and forfeiting loot to receive Desiccated pages can provide competitive runecraft experience rates. The pages are untradeable and stackable, and can be converted into burnt, soaked, or soiled pages for 50 runecraft experience per page.

With high combat stats and suitable gear, in duos, this can work out at approximately 20,000 runecraft experience per hour for each player with additional combat experience and opportunities to receive the tertiary drops from the Royal Titans.

Levels 59–82/91: Double cosmic runes
For more information about runecrafting through the Abyss, see Abyss/Strategies.

Crafting cosmic runes requires completion of the Lost City quest. Even though cosmic runes become available at level 27, it is not recommended to craft them before level 59 due to much lower profit. Crafting double cosmic runes offers very slow experience, but it can yield good profit at lower levels depending on the rune prices.

The fastest way to craft cosmic runes is through the Abyss. Alternatively, players can use a fairy ring to teleport to Zanaris and run to the altar, which can be slightly faster for those with low Mining and/or Agility levels. Players will need to have level 66 Agility for the shortcut, as well as quick access to a fairy ring, such as the quest point cape, Construction cape or necklace of passage.

With 70+ Agility and a quest point cape or another form of quick fairy ring teleport, it is possible to get 60 inventories done per hour with high concentration using essence pouches. For this method, players should be on the Lunar Spellbook and have a rune pouch containing air, astral, and cosmic runes ready in their bank for casting NPC Contact when replacing their ring of dueling. Stamina potions, or a revitalisation pool in the player's POH, will also be required.

Levels 82–99: Double astral runes

Crafting double astral runes can yield good profit depending on the rune prices. This method requires completion of Lunar Diplomacy. Even though astral runes become available at level 40 Runecraft, it is not recommended to craft them before level 82 due to much lower profit.

To craft astral runes, cast Tele Group Moonclan on the Lunar spellbook, run south-east to the altar, craft runes, and bank for more essence. Repair the essence pouches via NPC Contact and restore run energy as needed. Bank the astral runes from the rune pouch when it becomes full.

The optimal setup consists of the following:
All essence pouches available, or the colossal pouch (at level 85).
Dust battlestaff and the rune pouch with astral, law, and cosmic runes.
Crafting cape or a ring of dueling for fast banking.
Raiments of the eye set for extra profit (recommended).
Some defensive equipment to reduce damage taken from the suqah. 
Ring of endurance with at least 500 charges if using the Crafting cape (optional).

Experience and profit rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume using rings of dueling to bank at Castle Wars and using the best essence pouch(es) available. The profit rates include the cost of teleports, NPC Contact runes (before level 99), stamina potions, and pure essence. At level 99, it is possible to gain up to 59,000 experience per hour.

Some players like to use the Nardah teleport on the Desert amulet 4 from the Elite Desert Diary to refill their energy and health by praying at the Elidinis Statuette. This eliminates the need for stamina potions, food and/or defensive equipment.

Levels 91–95/99: Double nature runes
For more information about runecrafting through the Abyss, see Abyss/Strategies.

Even though nature runes become available at level 44, it is not recommended to craft them before level 91 due to much lower profit. Crafting double nature runes without using the Achievement diary cape offers slow experience, but it can yield good profit depending on the rune prices. With the Achievement diary cape, experience and profit rates increase significantly, offering some of the highest profit per hour in Runecraft, along with competitive experience rates.

There are four main ways to reach the nature altar: by using the Abyss; by using the fairy ring  and running north-east; by using the Karamja gloves 3 or 4 teleport to the gem mine; or by using the Achievement diary cape teleport to Kaleb Paramaya. Both the Karamja gloves and the Achievement diary cape methods require level 79 Agility, in order to use the shortcut on the north wall of Shilo village.

The Achievement diary cape method is over twice as fast as the other methods; however, the cape has very high requirements. The Abyss, fairy ring and Karamja gloves methods are similar in speed. Players with level 79 Agility or higher should use the Karamja gloves method. Players with low Mining and Agility are likely to get higher rates using the fairy ring, and players without fast access to a fairy ring and without access to the Agility shortcut should use the Abyss.

Players using the Achievement diary cape can use the cape's teleport to Jarr for banking, saving the need for an extra bank teleport item. For the fairy ring method, players will need to have a quick access to a fairy ring that does not take up inventory space, such as quest point cape, Construction cape or necklace of passage; and use a ring of dueling to bank at Castle Wars. 

Training Runecraft from level 91 to level 99 using this method requires 792,400 pure essence and yields 1,584,800 nature runes, which can be sold for tremendous profit.

Levels 95–99: Double law runes
For more information about runecrafting through the Abyss, see Abyss/Strategies.

Crafting double law runes offers very slow experience, but it can yield good profit depending on the rune prices. Players are able to craft two law runes per pure essence at level 95, and they grant 9.5 experience per pure essence used. Even though law runes become available at level 54, it is not recommended to craft them before level 95 due to much lower profit.

The fastest way of crafting law runes is through the Abyss. However, players cannot bring any weapons or armour as the Law Altar is located on Entrana. This can be overcome by bringing a bronze pickaxe to every trip and dropping it before entering the portal. It is faster to have a pickaxe in the inventory and use the Mining obstacles, than use the Thieving obstacles which do not require any space.

Alternatively, players can use the balloon transport system from Castle Wars to Entrana, run to the altar and bank at Castle Wars. This is slightly slower than using the Abyss, but requires paying less attention. Each trip with a balloon uses a regular log, and it is recommended to store multiple logs into the crates beforehand to save a bit of time. When arriving to Entrana, click straight north and this will result in the pathfinder generating a path to run all around the island, which can then be cancelled after crossing the bridge to get to the Law Altar.

Training Runecraft from level 95 to level 99 using this method requires 448,724 pure essence and yields 897,448 law runes, which can be sold for tremendous profit.

Levels 90–99: Aether runes

If you're not 99 runecrafting make sure to attach a cosmic tiara to the Hat of the eye. Or bring a cosmic tiara, cosmic talisman, or use the abyss as a point of entry into the altar.

Crafting aether runes offers relatively fast experience and can be profitable depending on the Grand Exchange prices. They are crafted by using soul runes on the Cosmic Altar with aether catalyst in the inventory. Crafting aether runes requires level 90 Runecraft.

This method requires the following:
 Soul runes and aether catalyst in the inventory.
 Level 82 Magic to cast Magic Imbue and NPC Contact, runes for them (astral, fire, water, air, and cosmic), and the rune pouch to save inventory space.
 With completion of elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary wear a mist/smoke battlestaff and a tome of fire/water, respectively, to save runes.
 The crafted aether runes can be used for a cosmic rune for the NPC Contact spell.
 Binding necklaces to ensure combination runes are crafted 100% of the time.
 Colossal pouch (or essence pouches up to giant) to carry more essence per run.
 Fast access to fairy rings. The fairy ring in the player-owned house and using the Constuction cape teleport is the best option.
 Alternatively, use the quest point cape teleport or the eternal slayer ring.
 Completion of the elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary allows using fairy rings without a dramen staff.
 Level 66 Agility for access to the shortcut in Zanaris.
 A fast bank teleport, such as the Crafting cape or a ring of dueling.
 Raiments of the Eye set for extra profit (strongly recommended for this method).

Starting at the bank, use the fairy ring to Zanaris. Run south to the altar, going through the eastern jutting wall shortcut. Cast Magic Imbue, use soul runes on the altar to craft aether runes.

Experience rates in the table below assume using the POH fairy ring with the Construction cape and rings of dueling to bank at Castle Wars. Expect lower rates if using worse teleports or having extra items in the inventory. The profit rates include the cost of teleports, NPC Contact runes (before level 99), and pure essence. At level 99, it is possible to gain up to 104,000 experience per hour.

Levels 95–99: Wrath runes

Crafting wrath runes is a profitable alternative to the faster methods. This method requires completion of Dragon Slayer II. Players will also need to run past aggressive dragons, so dragonfire protection is necessary.

Players can gain up to around 44,880 experience per hour using this method assuming they are able to complete 85 runs/hour, though this requires decent focus and a nearly optimal setup to achieve. At this rate, players would also make  profit per hour at the current rune prices ( when using the Raiments of the Eye). Using this method from level 95 to 99 would take around 95 hours and would offer roughly  profit. A more relaxed pace of 75 runs/hour would yield an hourly rate of 39,600 experience and  profit ( when using the Raiments of the Eye), and would take approximately 107 hours to reach level 99 from level 95. Higher rates are possible but difficult to achieve without a Max Cape or Runecraft Cape to eliminate the need for repairing essence pouches.

Setup and runecrafting
The optimal setup consists of the following:
Wrath tiara  or Raiments of the Eye
A shield that offers dragonfire protection, such as the dragonfire shield
Mythical cape
Bank teleport, such as the Crafting cape or a ring of dueling
All essence pouches
Weight-reducing clothing
Regen bracelet
Some defensive equipment
Charged Ring of Endurance

For efficient banking, players should have essence, 1-dose stamina potions, runes for NPC Contact, and some cheap food near the 'Deposit inventory' button. Players are also recommended to lock their mythical cape and essence pouch using deposit lock in the bank settings. This way, players can quickly deposit all the crafted runes without depositing any necessary items.

This method goes as follows:
 Fill pouches and inventory with essence.
 Teleport to Myths' Guild with the mythical cape.
 Run through cave and into altar.
 Craft wrath runes.
 Teleport to a bank, and repeat the process. Drink stamina potions, eat food as needed, and repair the essence pouches as needed. Alternatively, you may teleport to your house or Nardah via the Desert Amulet 4 to restore both health and run energy to conserve supplies.

Post 99
After level 99, experience rates will remain constant. Assuming that the player is wearing full Raiments of the Eye, is using colossal pouch, wears their runecraft cape and has access to the most efficient teleports and method-specific gear and items such as an abyssal lantern and binding necklaces, the table below provides some expected rates of experience per hour:

===== Construction training =====
Training Construction can be quite costly, but it has significant utility throughout Old School RuneScape including for transportation, combat, clue scrolls, and socializing.

Starting off
To start off, the Daddy's Home miniquest grants a total of 944 Construction experience as well as a crate of Construction supplies. This will get the player up from level 1 to 8. Players that are going for Angler's outfit should start at Fishing Trawler. 100 trips would require a minimum of 1000 swamp paste, or 5100 if gaining max points. 5100 fixes would also provide 25,500 construction experience, equivalent to level 36. Alternatively, purchase a player-owned house from any estate agent for . The house will have two rooms – a parlour and a garden – and no furniture apart from the exit portal in the garden.

A players' house portal is located in Rimmington by default, but can be moved for a fee. It is recommended to have level 40 Magic to be able to cast Teleport to House. Alternatively, use teleport to house tablets.

Construction is typically trained by repeatedly building and removing various furniture inside the player-owned house. To build furniture, enter the player-owned house in building mode or enable it through settings while inside. Players will need a saw and a hammer to build items.

General information and tips
Hotkeys
thumb|200px|Using the trick to build and remove without moving the mouse after right clicking.

To minimise mouse movement, use resizable mode and zoom all the way in. Widen the game client slightly so that there is some space between the chat box and the right hand side control panel. Position the hotspot you want to train at the bottom of the screen. Then position the mouse over the hotspot and slightly higher than the report button. When done right, the build and remove options should be in the same spot as the right-click.

When building various items in the player-owned house, there will be a number hotkey for fast Construction training. When removing the said item(s), press the "1" key to immediately remove it.

Managing inventory while training

 Phials 
From level 1 to 40, have the player-owned house in Rimmington. Bring noted planks in the inventory and unnote them at Phials for 5 coins each. This is faster than fetching the planks from a bank. If available, wear weight-reducing clothing to reduce run energy consumption while getting more planks. When entering back to the house, right-click the house portal to enter the house in building mode.

 Servants 
At level 40, hire a servant from the Servants' Guild in East Ardougne to unnote more planks. To be able to hire a servant, the player's house must have at least two bedrooms with beds constructed in each one. Using a servant is much faster than unnoting planks at Phials. This costs money, but the increased speed is well worth the extra cost.

Use the Butler from level 40 to 50, and the Demon butler from level 50 onwards. Using lower-level servants is not recommended, because all other servants below the human butler are slower than manually using Phials.

Servants will request a payment after 8 services completed. At lower levels, players will need to have coins in their inventory to pay them. At level 58, build the servant's money bag in one of the bedrooms and put coins in it to automatically pay the servant while they perform tasks. This also skips the dialogue of the servant requesting payment, which will save time.

Efficiency

Because almost all Construction training methods are available to players as early as level 52, a main differentiator between training methods and plank choice is cost (coins per experience) and speed (experience per hour). At current prices:
 Oak planks cost  each and grant 60 XP when used in a POH ( per XP).
 Mahogany planks cost  each and grant 140 XP when used in a POH ( per XP).

Assuming the best and most efficient training methods you are capable of are:
 550,000 XP per hour with oak planks (9166 planks per hour)
 1,100,000 XP per hour with mahogany planks (7856 planks per hour)

Then the total investment required to gain 1.1 million XP is either:
 2 hours with oak planks, at a cost of  for 18332 planks plus  for servants.
 1 hour with mahogany planks, at a cost of  for 7856 planks plus  for servants.
 
That means in order to save 1 hour of time, it costs . This would only ever be worthwhile if you can feasibly earn more than this amount per hour with your time, or simply prefer doing other activities enough to accept the cost associated with saving that time.

The carpenter's outfit provides 2.5% extra experience, which can help to save money, but will generally not save time given that most Construction training methods provide very high experience per hour. If time is the main concern, the outfit is not worth getting for level 99 unless training via Mahogany Homes.

Prices
Planks are the primary material for training, and using them costs money. Buy the planks from the Grand Exchange. While making planks from logs can save money, especially with the Plank Make spell, it does not give any Construction experience and is therefore considered simply a money making method for normal accounts.

There are four tiers of planks: regular, oak, teak, and mahogany, each with increasing cost and experience gained from using it. Planks yield the same amount of experience per plank regardless of what furniture is built, except for the mounted mythical cape and some low-level furniture which use regular planks. As such, use the highest-tier planks for the fastest experience rates, or look into cheaper alternatives if trying to save money.

The table below shows the costs to obtain level 83 (a common level to achieve, as it is possible to boost +8 for the ornate jewellery box).

Fastest experience

Passive experience
Experience gained through non-Construction activities can be considered "free" and help skip early levels:

 Fishing Trawler provides 5 Construction experience per fixed leak while earning a full angler's outfit. Outfit luck varies widely but on average, 11,220 Construction experience will be earned assuming 44 games and full contribution points per game.
 Wintertodt provides a steady amount of Construction experience equal to 4x current Construction level. As with other multiplier methods, this is quite effective at gaining new levels roughly from level 4-27 before it slows down considerably.
 Vale Totems provides Construction experience equal to the current level for each totem crafted.
 At level 30 Construction, players can turn long and curved bones in to Barlak for both Construction experience and some coins. He can be found inside the city of Dorgesh-Kaan, which requires completion of Death to the Dorgeshuun to access. These bones are somewhat rare and are primarily dropped by monsters which also drop big bones.

Levels 1–33: Starting off
The table below shows the furniture and materials needed to reach level 33.

Regular planks require using nails. Use steel nails or better, as lower-tier nails bend more often. Start using oak planks at level 15, as they are faster to use than regular planks as they do not require using nails.

Levels 33–52/74: Oak larders 
From level 33 to 52, build oak larders in the Kitchen. Oak larders require 8 oak planks to build, and they grant 480 experience each.

Players can gain up to around 480,000 experience per hour from level 50 onwards. If planning to keep using oak planks for cheaper experience, switch to oak dungeon doors (listed below) at level 74 for faster rates.

Levels 52–99: Mahogany furniture
Building mahogany furniture becomes the fastest viable training method at level 52. It is very expensive, so look into cheaper alternatives (such as teak or oak furniture) if trying to save money. Players can gain up to around 900,000 experience per hour with mahogany tables, or 1,100,000 experience per hour with gnome benches.

Mahogany tables in the dining room are the fastest way to use mahogany planks until level 77. Each mahogany table requires 6 mahogany planks and gives 840 experience. The optimal method is to build 3 tables and remove 2 tables in the time the demon butler takes to fetch 24 planks from the bank (22 ticks/inventory cycle on a consistently low-ping world). In higher-ping worlds, it is recommended to remove 3 tables and build 2 tables (23 ticks/inventory) or build 2 tables and remove 2 tables (24 ticks/inventory) while the demon butler fetches planks. The 22-tick inventory cycle is shown below:

With good attention, players can easily expect to go from level 52 to level 77 within 2 hours.

At level 77, players can build gnome benches in the superior garden, which offers the best possible experience rate of just over 1,100,000 experience per hour. Gnome benches require 6 mahogany planks and give 840 experience, just like the tables; however, benches can be built and removed in alternation since the two hotspots are adjacent to one another.

The method for building gnome benches is as follows:

Stand on the inner tile between both bench hotspots with 18 Mahogany Planks.
Call servant and send the Demon Butler to bring 24 Mahogany Planks from your bank.
On the next tick, click to remove the built bench.
On the next tick, click to build on the empty hotspot.
Every time you build a bench, repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of planks. 
The Demon Butler will return and restock your planks.
Build and remove one bench using the new supplies before sending him back to the bank (returning to step 2).
This method takes advantage of the fact that removing furniture takes only one tick and can occur simultaneously with opening the build interface to save time. This allows for a third build rotation while the Demon Butler is collecting supplies from the bank, as compared with only two rotations if building and removing on only one hotspot.

Other methods

Levels 1–99: Mahogany Homes
Mahogany Homes is a cheaper and less click-intensive alternative to the faster methods. Players work as a contractor for the Mahogany Homes company, repairing and replacing furniture in client NPCs' houses throughout Falador, Varrock, East Ardougne, and Hosidius. 

To begin, speak to Amy in Falador after acquiring a player-owned house. Have her assign a construction contract, travel to the client's house, refurbish the marked furniture, and talk to the client to finish. Subsequent contracts can also be assigned by Marlo in Varrock, Ellie in East Ardougne, or Angelo in Hosidius. They are found in the same buildings as the cities' respective estate agents.

Building the furniture requires the respective planks for the contract tier and steel bars. A hammer and a saw is required to build the furniture. Nails are not required. For optimal rates, players will need teleports to all four cities, such as teleport tablets or runes, and a charged Xeric's talisman for Hosidius.

Completing a contract will reward the player with Construction experience and Carpenter points. The points can be exchanged for additional rewards, such as the Carpenter's outfit, the plank sack, and supply crates. Additionally, the client will offer the player a cup of tea, replenishing their run energy to 100% after completing the contract.

Estimated costs for this training method are  GP/XP for Novice contracts,  GP/XP for Adept contracts, and  GP/XP for Expert contracts (see chart below).

Levels 50–99: Mounted mythical capes
Mounted mythical capes are a cheaper alternative to mahogany or other teak furniture. They require 3 teak planks each along with a mythical cape. The cape is returned after removing the furniture. Each mounted mythical cape gives 370 experience, granting more experience per teak plank than other teak furniture. However, oak larders offer faster experience and are usually similar in cost.

Building mounted mythical capes requires completion of Dragon Slayer II, which requires having at least level 50 Construction. In case of mistakes, have an equipable item in the inventory as players cannot remove a mounted mythical cape if they have a full inventory of planks.

Send the demon butler away with 6 planks still in your inventory.
Remove and build 2 mounted mythical capes.
After the second remove, wait 1 tick and the butler will return with 24 planks.

Players can gain up to around 430,000 experience per hour with maximum efficiency. Expect lower rates if making mistakes.

Levels 66–74/99: Teak garden benches
Building teak garden benches is the fastest way to use teak planks. They require 6 teak planks to build and give 540 experience each. This method is similar to gnome benches, offering slower (albeit still relatively fast) experience while being cheaper. As with gnome benches, this method requires precise timing and accurate clicks. Any mistakes will lower the experience rates considerably, and players may get faster rates with other options.

Players can gain a maximum of around 700,000 experience per hour building garden benches at level 66 with perfect execution, however most players should expect to gain 500,000 to 600,000 experience per hour. With good execution, it should take roughly an hour to reach level 74, at which point players may consider building oak dungeon doors instead, which offer slightly slower experience rates at the benefit of potentially reduced cost. Likewise, players who wish to gain faster experience may find it better to spend extra money on building mahogany furniture instead, as this would save around 7–8 hours on the way to level 99 depending on the method and efficiency.

Levels 74–99: Oak dungeon doors
thumb|The servant is forced to spawn right next to the player if the door is built when they return.
Building oak dungeon doors is a cheaper and less click-intensive alternative to mahogany or teak furniture. Building an oak door requires 10 oak planks and grants 600 Construction experience. Players can gain up to around 550,000 experience per hour at maximum efficiency.

With the demon butler, the player should hold down 1 constantly and use the 'build and remove' trick as seen above. Starting from a full inventory of planks, repeat the following steps:

 Click the demon butler to make him fetch 25 oak planks.
 Build and remove 2 doors, leaving the second one built. You should have 5-8 spare oak planks in your inventory at this point.
 When the demon butler comes back, remove and build a door, then click the demon butler twice to take the remaining planks and send him away.
 Return to step 2.
Alternatively, asking the butler to fetch 20 oak planks will yield slightly lower experience rates while taking away some potential to make mistakes and reducing the amount of required steps per banking cycle. One can still expect to get upwards of 500,000 experience per hour even when making occasional mistakes and without paying full attention.

Since oak dungeon doors are on the 1 option of their build interface, using two RuneLite plugins and holding 1 (Custom Menu Swaps and Menu Entry Swapper) allows for the least-intensive construction training approach that still outputs very good xp rates.

 Use the custom swap "Talk-to,Demon Butler" to give him priority over the door on left clicks.
 Menu entry swap the door space to build, and the built doors to remove.
 Hold 1, and get familiar with the click timings. This eliminates having to switch keys and having to right click.

===== Pay-to-play Hitpoints training =====
Unlike most skills, Hitpoints is rarely leveled on its own, as most methods of training combat skills (Attack, Strength, Defence, Ranged, and Magic) also give Hitpoints experience. However, there are a few methods for training Hitpoints specifically.

Training Hitpoints through combat
Each point of damage dealt directly by the player yields 1.33 Hitpoints XP. Therefore, any combat training method that offers a high XP rate will also train Hitpoints at a high rate.

Melee training
Magic training
Ranged training

Ice Burst/Barrage
After completion of Monkey Madness I and Desert Treasure I, with at least 70 Magic, players can cast Ice Burst/Ice Barrage on the Skeletal Monkeys in the Ape Atoll Dungeon, granting a high amount of Magic and Hitpoints experience per hour. After completion of Monkey Madness II, killing maniacal monkeys with Ice Burst/Ice Barrage is another method that offers even more experience per hour.

Chinchompas
Red or black chinchompas can be used in a similar way to barrage spells, by using them on maniacal monkeys on Ape Atoll for fast Ranged and Hitpoints XP.

Training Hitpoints alone
Skill pures (also known as skillers) or other accounts who wish to train Hitpoints without training other combat skills have a few options. Experience lamps from random events, cleaning finds in the Varrock Museum, completing Achievement Diaries, etc. can be applied to Hitpoints. They can also participate in the Pest Control and Soul Wars minigames and spend reward points on Hitpoints experience, although both require combat levels to enter. Training manuals from the tackling organised crime minigame can also be used for Hitpoints experience, although some combat is required to receive them.

The Witch's House quest can be completed using only rings of recoil, and awards 6325 Hitpoints XP. Observatory Quest also may reward Hitpoints XP--the reward is chosen randomly from a list of several options.

Hitpoints is almost always trained through combat with any of the combat styles, melee, ranged, or magic. The ratio of combat experience to hitpoint experience is 3:1 for melee and ranged. For magic it is dependent on the spell being used, the magic defence of the target, and the attack style used. Skill pures, also known as skillers, can train Hitpoints with experience lamps to avoid combat, the only way to do so in free-to-play.

===== Agility training =====
Agility training involves a lot of point-clicking and some methods may require a lot of focus to maximise experience gain. Higher Agility level increases one's ability to regenerate run energy and grants access to various shortcuts.

For the fastest rates, players should always run and use stamina potions (or some other form of run energy restoration) to maintain run energy if needed. Keeping weight at 0 or below is helpful, but not necessary. It is recommended to boost the Agility level by using summer pies or agility potions to train on a higher-level course earlier than it is available. Players who are failing obstacles very frequently or have low Hitpoints are advised to bring some food to restore health.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–26/33: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Agility experience. Completing The Tourist Trap (using experience on Agility two times), Recruitment Drive, The Depths of Despair and The Grand Tree will grant a total of 19,700 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 33. These quests can be easily done at a low level and they have little requirements, however all of them involve some sort of combat. Notably, the experience rewards from The Tourist Trap alone are enough to get the player from level 1 to 26, and it is faster to complete the quest than train on the low-level Agility courses.

Levels 20–47: Brimhaven Agility Arena
Brimhaven Agility Arena offers the fastest experience from level 20 to 47. Players must have 200 coins to pay the entry fee for the course. Level 40 is required to pass all obstacles in the course, but the Floor spikes trap provides the fastest experience rate and only requires Level 20 to pass. By repeatedly passing this trap, players can gain up to 30,000 experience per hour as low as level 15 with the use of Summer pie to boost your agility level. Bringing food is advised as you will occasionally fail the trap.   

Approximately every 60 seconds a pillar in the arena will activate (signified with a yellow arrow) and will improve experience rates if tagged, increasing by 30 XP every 10 levels. It will additionally reward the player with Agility arena tickets which can be traded in to Pirate Jackie the Fruit at the Arena entrance for additional experience. As your agility level increases it becomes more worth it to tag them for the additional experience.  

At level 40 you will be able to pass every obstacle in the arena, and you can then expect to gain around 45,000-50,000 experience per hour when tagging every pillar and using the floor spikes trap during the downtime. This is without the use of Karamja gloves; wearing Karamja gloves 2 or above will increase the experience rates from passing obstacles and trading in tickets by 10%.  

Additionally, the floor spike obstacle can be used, which is very AFK and can achieve approx 36,000 experience per hour. Using the "Detached Camera" plugin, you can click a single tile to repeatedly jump back and forth. If the nearby ticket dispensers are active, tagging them can provide some extra experience.  

Levels 47–62: Wilderness Agility Course

The Wilderness Agility Course offers the fastest experience rates from level 47 to 62. Level 52 is normally required to enter the course, but this can be boosted from level 47 with a summer pie. However, level 49 is required to pass the pipe obstacle, requiring occasional re-boosting if below.

The easiest way to get there is to break an Ice Plateau Teleport tablet and run slightly south-east. Because this method involves the deep Wilderness, players should keep the risk to the minimum as there is a good chance of encountering player killers. Bring some summer pies to boost the Agility level and to heal the damage taken from failing the obstacles. Additionally, bring a knife or Wilderness sword to slash webs when going to the Mage Arena to bank for more supplies. Boots of lightness and the spottier cape can be worn to reduce weight.

The experience bonus, agility ticket, and run energy refill at the end of the lap is only received if the player has passed all the obstacles in order. If the player fails the log balance, walk past the stepping stones to cross it again to be able to receive the completion bonus.

Players can gain around 50,000–60,000 experience per hour when including fails and wilderness agility tickets. It also provides alchables, noted blighted items, and medium clue scrolls, making it a potentially lucrative money maker, even for Ironmen.

Levels 62–99: Hallowed Sepulchre

thumb|right|250px|The Hallowed Sepulchre.
The Hallowed Sepulchre offers the fastest experience from level 62 onwards. In the Sepulchre, the player will need to run through each floor while avoiding various traps. Doing so as quickly as possible requires good practice and timing, especially on the later floors.

To access the Hallowed Sepulchre, players must have completed Sins of the Father. Having level 66 Thieving to be able to loot the Grand Hallowed Coffin on floor 5 is recommended. If looting the other coffins on floors 4 and 5, the player will also need the following:
  to pass broken bridges 
  to pass Saradomin braziers
  to pass portal frames
  to pass pillars

Use stamina potions (or some other form of run energy restoration) to restore run energy. Using the obelisks to restore run energy is slower than drinking stamina potions, and with enough mistakes it is possible to run out of run energy during the floor.

The activity becomes highly profitable at level 92 Agility, where the player can loot the Grand Hallowed Coffin. Most of the profit comes from the ring of endurance, with the hourly profit currently being . Players can also loot the coffins on floors 4 and 5 for extra profit, though this will lower the experience rates slightly. Looting the coffins on floors 1–3 is not recommended except for obtaining hallowed marks, as they offer much lower profit compared to the later floors.

For 200 hallowed marks, players can unlock a private instance by speaking to the Mysterious stranger. In a private instance the floors will always spawn on the same trap rotation. This makes the floors more predictable, which will increase long-term experience rates.

The experience rates in the table below assume having good practice and using a private instance. Expect lower rates when learning. The maximum experience rate caps at around 102,000–105,000 experience per hour, or 105,000–108,000 experience per hour without looting the Grand Coffin.

Other methods
Levels 1–99: Rooftop Agility Courses
thumb|right|100px|A mark of grace.
Rooftop Agility Courses are slower but straightforward and less attention-intensive alternatives to the faster training methods. While training on one of the rooftop courses, there is a chance of finding a mark of grace. These can be used to purchase the pieces of the graceful outfit, recolour existing pieces of the graceful outfit, or purchase amylase crystals which can be sold for profit. Considering the GE price of amylase crystals, each mark of grace is worth .

As rooftop courses are less attention-intensive it allows you to integrate other training methods while navigating the course, such as High Level Alchemy or Fletching training using Dart tips.

Marks of grace despawn after 10 minutes, so it is recommended to pick them up as they appear. However, on the Ardougne Rooftop Course the marks can only spawn on one tile, which stacks the marks and resets the 10-minute timer. The spawn rate of marks on any rooftop course (excluding the Canifis Rooftop Course) is reduced to 20% of the normal rate once the player reaches 20 Agility levels higher than the requirement of that rooftop course. For example, a player training on the Seers' Village course will get the reduced rate at level 80.

There are non-rooftop courses that also award marks, either directly like the Werewolf Agility Course or indirectly via their own currency like the Colossal Wyrm Course. For a full list of sources of marks and approximate rates refer to Mark of grace§Marks of grace per hour.

Notably, the spawn rate for marks on this course does not decrease after reaching level 60. 50–60 Falador	 29,000–34,000 9.7–11.3 60–70 Seers' Village Hard diary: 50,000–56,000

No diary: 11.8–13.0 The hard Kandarin Diary reward allows the player to toggle the Camelot Teleport location to just outside (south) of the Seers' bank, right in front of the start of the agility course. Using this teleport is required for the fastest rates on this course. 70–80/90 Pollnivneach Hard diary:

No hard diary: 47,000–51,000 13-14 Completion of the hard Desert Diary increases the experience gained from this course and is required for the fastest experience rates.  80–90 Rellekka Hard diary: 59,000–63,000

No hard diary: 50,000–53,000 13–15.5 Completion of the hard Fremennik Diary increases the experience gained from this course and is required for the fastest experience rates. 90–99 Ardougne 66,000–70,000 Elite diary: 20.9–22.1

No elite diary: 16.8–17.9 Completing the elite Ardougne Diary grants more marks of grace per hour. Because marks of grace can only spawn on one tile on this course, players do not need to pick up the marks immediately as they spawn, since spawning a new mark resets the despawn timer of the whole stack, allowing them to stay on the ground for as long as the player continues doing laps.

Levels 15–40: Edgeville Dungeon monkeybars
Repeatedly crossing the monkeybar shortcut in the Edgeville Dungeon offers up to 13,200 experience per hour. With the right camera angle, it is possible to keep the mouse cursor in one spot and continuously click. Because the monkeybars are located in the Wilderness, the player may get attacked by player killers.

Levels 15–74: Barbarian Fishing
Barbarian Fishing grants small amounts of passive Agility and Strength experience. Levelling Fishing from level 58 to 99 by Barbarian Fishing would get the player from level 30 Agility to 74. If the player plans to train Fishing through Barbarian Fishing at any point, it is best to do so before training Agility as it would allow the player to skip the slower low-level methods.

 Levels 30+: Agility Pyramid 
thumb|width=200x200|A player training on the Agility Pyramid.
The Agility Pyramid is a straightforward, profitable method of training agility with little requirements. Before reaching higher levels the failure rate may slow progress, but each completion of the pyramid awards a Pyramid top worth  coins when traded to Simon Templeton. Roughly 13 completions can be made per hour at early levels (30-50), for  gp/hour and 25,000 experience per hour. Upwards of 26 completions per hour can be made at higher levels, (70-99), for  gp/hour and approximately 44,000 experience per hour.

 Levels 40/50+: Brimhaven Agility Arena 
The Brimhaven Agility Arena offers a different approach to training agility. Every minute a ticket dispense will be marked, requiring you to navigate the course to 'tag' the pillar to receive a Agility arena ticket, which can be exchanged with Pirate Jackie the Fruit for 345 Agility experience per ticket. Players wearing Karamja gloves 2, 3 or 4 will receive an additional 10% experience, giving 379.5 Agility experience per ticket.

Experience rates vary depending on the player's Agility level. At level 99, expect to be able to achieve up to 67,000 Agility experience per hour. At level 40 Agility, players can earn roughly 28,000 XP per hour (or 30,000 experience per hour with Karamja gloves 2). At level 80 agility, players can earn roughly 35,000 experience per hour (or roughly 37,000 experience per hour with Karamja gloves 2). If the Elite tier of the Karamja Diary is complete, players can expect roughly 2,277 experience per hour added onto these rates (regardless of Agility level).

Additionally, the floor spike trap obstacle just south west of the entrance can be used, which is very low focus and can achieve approximately 36,000 experience per hour. This can be used in one of two ways: 

 Using the "Detached Camera"  runelite plugin, you can click a single tile to repeatedly jump back and forth. 
 Using the GPU runelite plugin with "Draw distance" set high enough for you to be able to see the area beyond the arena's wall to the east. First cross the spike trap once to position your character correctly, then repeatedly anywhere beyond the arena walls to the east. If done correctly your character will run back and forth over the spike trap. This can be resumed if you stop clicking as long as you don't move your character away from the tiles they stand on after crossing the trap. If you need to reset your character just manually cross the trap and resume clicking outside the arena walls (video example).

If the nearby ticket dispensers are active, tagging them can provide some extra experience. 

Levels 48–52/60: Ape Atoll Agility Course
The Ape Atoll Agility Course is a viable alternative for players who have completed chapter 2 of Monkey Madness I. To access this course, players must wear a ninja monkey greegree (either variant will work) or a Kruk greegree. Any other type of monkey greegree will not work. Boosts cannot be used to enter the course before level 48 Agility.

Players can gain around 30,000–35,000 experience per hour at level 48, increasing to around 45,000–50,000 experience per hour at higher levels. Players stop failing the obstacles at level 75, from which point onwards it is possible to gain up to 55,000 experience per hour. Completing 2,000 laps of this course will additionally unlock all Monkey Backpacks, making it worthwhile for player wanting these cosmetic rewards.

Levels 45–52/60: Shayzien Advanced Agility Course
The Shayzien Advanced Agility Course is an alternative for players who cannot access the Ape Atoll Agility Course or do not wish to train on the Wilderness Agility Course. Completing this course requires a crossbow and a mith grapple. Players can gain around 35,000 experience per hour at level 45.

Levels 50/62: Colossal Wyrm Agility Course
The Colossal Wyrm Agility Course is a less click-intensive course that offers an alternative way to get Amylase crystals. The course rewards blessed bone shards for Prayer xp, and Termites, which can be traded in with Worm Tongue for a unique graceful recolour, calcified acorn, colossal wyrm teleport scrolls, and Amylase packs. The Amylase packs can also be sold to Grace for 8 marks of grace each, which makes the advanced course the fastest way to get marks of grace until the Ardougne rooftop course at level 90.

There are two routes, the basic course requires 50 Agility and gives up to 30,000 xp/hr, and the advanced course requires 62 Agility and gives up to 41,000 xp/hr. The advanced route requires only 6 clicks per 60-second lap, with two sections of the course allowing a full 20 seconds of AFK time each.

Levels 60–80/90: Werewolf Agility Course
The Werewolf Agility Course is an alternative for those who seek for both decent experience rates and marks of grace. To access this course, players must have completed Creature of Fenkenstrain and wear a ring of charos. Consider switching to the Rellekka or Ardougne Rooftop Agility Course at level 80 or 90, respectively, as they offer similar experience rates and greater marks of grace per hour.

While this course requires level 60 Agility to use, players can use summer pies to boost to level 60 even at level 55. At levels 72 (and 93), the chance of failure on the Death Slide is significantly reduced. With level 80 in Agility and Strength, the death-slide can no longer be failed, provided the player's weight is below 2kg.

With good concentration and timing, players can gain up to around 50,000–55,000 experience per hour at lower levels and 67,000–68,000 experience per hour at higher. The Agility Trainer (the NPC the player returns the stick to) can be trapped into place by having another account talking to him, which increases experience rates slightly, up to 70,000 experience per hour at higher levels. In addition, players can get about 10–15 marks of grace per hour.

Levels 75–99: Prifddinas Agility Course

The Prifddinas Agility Course offers a less click-intensive training option from level 75 onwards, being similar to the Rooftop Agility Courses. Players must have completed Song of the Elves to access this course. Players can find crystal shards by using portals that randomly appear around the course, which act as shortcuts. These portal shortcuts are unique to each player, and grant the player a crystal shard every time they pass through them.

Players can gain up to around 60,000 experience per hour at level 75, increasing to 65,000 experience per hour from level 90 onwards. Expect lower rates if idling. At maximum rates, players can also find 48.5 crystal shards per hour, worth approximately  if used to create divine super combat potions.

===== Herblore training =====
Herblore training usually involves making potions which can only begin after completing the Druidic Ritual quest granting the player level 3 Herblore. To make a potion, the player will have to gather the required ingredients, usually a herb of some sort along with a secondary ingredient, and use them on a vial of water, blood, or coconut milk.

The fastest way to train Herblore is to add secondary ingredients to unfinished potions. If the player banks fairly quickly after each inventory of potions, they can expect to make around 2,500 potions per hour.

A profitable, although slow method to train Herblore is to clean grimy herbs.

Making potions

For more in depth calculations and variations about the cost per experience, see Calculator:Herblore/Potions. 

The most efficient way to gain Herblore experience is to make potions by combining base and secondary ingredients. The fastest Herblore experience is gained by simply making potions that offer the highest experience per hour; however, some slower options can be notably cheaper or even profitable, and should be considered if the player prefers to save money. Some options may also require a lot more capital than others.

An alchemist's amulet or amulet of chemistry can be used while training Herblore to save significant amounts of money or even make profit in some cases. One charge costs  or , respectively. This results in cost savings when a single dose is worth more than one charge. However, the amulet of chemistry requires more effort to use as it needs to be replaced when crumbled.

Prescription goggles are also very useful, as they provide a 10% chance to not consume secondary ingredients for most (but not all) potions. This can be especially important if making potions with expensive secondary ingredients, such as Aldarium.

The table below assumes that the resulting potions are decanted, if possible, into 4 doses before being sold, and takes the GE tax into account. It assumes 2,500 standard 14x14 potions made per hour, 2,750 for 27x1 (such as stamina potions), 2,330 for serum 207s, 2,166 for super combat potions, and 1,833 for forgotten brews and extended anti-venom+. For variable dose potions, ingredient costs assume decanting from the 4 dose precursor potion. Note that knowledge of GE-pricing can have a major effect on profits.

Serum 207s, stamina potions, extended antifires, anti-venoms and extended super antifire potions can all be manually sped up to 1 tick per potion at the cost of high intensity, allowing players to average 4,583 potions made per hour.

Making tar
An alternative, potentially cheaper method of training Herblore is making tar. This requires fewer clicks than potion making, since twice as many actions are performed before banking and the duration of each action is longer.

XP per hour is calculated at approximately 78 inventories fully processed per hour. Depending on bank efficiency, actual rates may be less.

If planning to train Herblore by making tar, it would be wise to buy or stockpile Swamp tar in advance. The buy limit of swamp tar is only 13,000 which is only enough tar to last approximately half an hour before running out.

Herb cleaning

thumb|Auto-cleaning herbs
thumb|Manually cleaning herbs, while more click-intensive, can be much quicker.
Cleaning grimy herbs is a slow but easy and profitable method to training Herblore. Since an update on 10 September 2020, cleaning grimy herbs automatically cleans all herbs in the inventory. Players may choose also choose to use Zahur, an NPC in Nardah, to clean the herbs for them. This will however cost the player GP, resulting in loss instead of profit.  

By using the auto-clean method, you can expect to clean up to 3,000 herbs per hour. Manually clicking on the herbs can easily double the speed of cleaning, and a fast player can expect over 10,000 cleaned herbs per hour, increasing the experience and profit per hour accordingly.

Tip: Consider cleaning herbs on a touchscreen device as it may be faster or more comfortable for longer durations.

The following rates assume you are cleaning an average of 10,000 herbs per hour. (Note that using the "auto-clean" feature yields 30% of the below experience rates per hour).
 LevelHerbGrimyClean Clean XPProfitXP/HourProfit/HourIcon Price VolumeIcon Price Volume

Degrime
An alternative, less click-intensive method, is to use the degrime Arceuus spell, requiring 70 Magic and the completion of A Kingdom Divided to be cast. You can cast approximately 600 casts per hour (47-50k magic xp/h), while potentially making profit.

Making Guthix rest

A medium-intensity but profitable way to train Herblore is to make Guthix rest, requiring 18 Herblore and partial completion of the One Small Favour quest. Brewing Guthix rest differs from other methods of training the skill, as care must be taken to not add extra herbs to the herb tea mix; doing so grants no experience and ruins the tea. If all ingredients are in the player's inventory, they can make the tea in one step, and subsequent teas are automatically made after making just one of them, granting 59 experience for each tea. Players should note that the amulet of chemistry has no effect when brewing Guthix rest. 

Making Guthix Rest requires a cup of hot water, 2 guam, 1 marrentill, and  1 harralander. Using a cup of hot water with any of the herbs will start the process. Ironman accounts or anyone looking to save money on ingredients can acquire cups of hot water by casting Humidify on an empty cup then using the cup of water on a range.

Due to the number of ingredients per tea, only five can be made per inventory, requiring 5 cups of hot water, 10 guam, 5 marrentill, and 5 harralander. 

With moderate concentration it is possible to make around 1400 cups of 3-dose Guthix rest per hour, costing . This results in 82,600 Herblore experience gained and a profit of  when using Bob Barter at the Grand Exchange to decant the teas into 4-dose variants before selling.

Level 60+/81+: Mastering Mixology

At level 60 and with completion of Children of the Sun, players can go to Aldarin and take part in the Mastering Mixology minigame, however it will become more efficient at higher levels, with the last unlock at level 81 Herblore. Mastering Mixology does not require specific herbs or any secondaries, and grants much more experience per herb compared to other methods. It is also the only source of some powerful utility items and features, such as the Prescription goggles, Alchemist's amulet, Chugging barrel, and Potion storage, so it can be advisable to do even if Herblore experience is not needed. A player with level 81 Herblore can expect to earn up to 105k xp/hour.

This is a guide for training the Thieving skill.

For maximum theoretical experience rates for certain Thieving training methods, see this page.

General information and tips
Tip for pickpocketing: Go to the options menu, go to the game controller at the top right, and select "Hidden" under "NPC 'Attack' options". This will turn the 'Pickpocket' option into a left-click, rather than a right-click. Also, one may pickpocket more than once in a single animation, so spam-clicking will maximise experience.

Ardougne Diary
Different tiers of the Ardougne Diary increase the chance of successfully pickpocketing various NPCs. The medium Ardougne Diary increases the player's chance of success when pickpocketing by 10% only within Ardougne. The hard Ardougne Diary extends this bonus to all of Gielinor. Having the Ardougne cloak equipped or in the inventory is not required to get this benefit.

Additionally, each tier of the diary increases the maximum amount of coin pouches that can be held before needing to open them:
 None/Easy: 28
 Medium: 56
 Hard: 84
 Elite: 140

As a result of both of these benefits, it is beneficial to have at least the hard tier of the diary done, as this gives the player both a buff to their chances at pickpocketing along with allowing them to pickpocket for longer before needing to open coin pouches. This increase experience rates and allows for less attention needed when pickpocketing, respectively.

Rogue equipment
While wearing components of the rogue equipment, there is a chance of pickpocketing twice the loot from an NPC. Wearing the full set guarantees double loot. Experience drops remain unaffected, however.

The set consists of the rogue mask, rogue top, rogue trousers, rogue gloves and rogue boots. Items from the outfit can be found while looting the wall safe at the end of the Rogues' Den minigame, which can be accessed at 50 Thieving, with 80 Thieving granting an additional shortcut to make it faster.

Dodgy necklace
Dodgy necklace gives the wearer a 25% chance to not be stunned and damaged when failing to pickpocket an NPC. This will increase experience rates if the player can fail to pickpocket the NPC. The necklace has 10 charges until it crumbles to dust.

Shadow Veil
While under the effects of the Shadow Veil spell, players have a 15% chance to avoid being stunned and damaged while pickpocketing NPCs. This stacks multiplicatively with the dodgy necklace, for a total of 36.25% chance to not take damage from a failed pickpocket. 

Gloves of silence
Gloves of silence increase players' success rate while pickpocketing by 5% while they are equipped. Wearing them requires level 54 Hunter. Gloves of silence can be bought from the Grand Exchange for  each or created at the Fancy Clothes Store in Varrock from 2 dark kebbit furs for a cost of .

The Ardougne Diary perks override the gloves of silence 5% success rate. Therefore, the gloves of silence become obsolete within Ardougne after completing the medium Ardougne Diary, or completely obsolete after completing the hard Ardougne Diary.

Gloves of silence are damaged each time that the player is unsuccessful in a pickpocketing attempt. They are destroyed after 62 failures, if counted from when they are new. If a player has multiple gloves of silence then they will all display the same status when their condition is checked. However, if the gloves of silence currently being used do fall apart, then any other pairs that the player owns are reset to the "new" condition. The condition of the gloves is only relevant to the player owning them, and is not a property of the gloves themselves. Players with at least level 64 Crafting can restore their gloves of silence to "new" condition by using 1 dark kebbit fur, costing , and thread, costing , on the gloves.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–42: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Thieving experience. Completing Biohazard, Hazeel Cult, Fight Arena, Tower of Life, and Tribal Totem grants a total of 7,200 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 24. These quests can be easily done at a low level and they have minimal requirements, however some of them involve some sort of combat.

Furthermore, completing The Queen of Thieves, The Giant Dwarf, Death to the Dorgeshuun, The Golem, Creature of Fenkenstrain, Twilight's Promise, Death on the Isle, Ethically Acquired Antiquities, and The Feud grants a total additional 41,500 experience, which will get the player up to level 42.

 Levels 1–36/45 Chambers of Xerics thieving room 
From level 1 to 45, you can train Thieving in the Chambers of Xeric raid atop Mount Quidamortem in the Kebos Lowlands. Bring a lockpick, (can obtain from a  Scavenger inside the raid) then reload the raid until the first room is a thieving room. Steal from 4 chests in a circular motion and you can expect experience rates of up to 35-50k experience an hour. Simply pick the locks until you get the prompt that you can't carry anymore grubs, drop the grubs, continue picking locks. (Placing enough grubs in the trough will render the activity "complete" and stop rewarding experience for opening chests) The easiest way to get to the Chambers of Xeric on a fresh account is by taking a minecart to  Mount Quidamortem from Port Piscarilius for 20 coins.

Experience rates can be improved by scaling the raid to 100+ players, which significantly reduces the chest respawn time. In certain room layouts, it’s possible to rotate between just two chests due to the fast respawn rate. Some players position their camera and character in a specific way to allow near-continuous clicking between the two chests without moving, improving both XP/hr and ease of use.

 Levels 36-45: Chests in Aldarin Villas 
Stealing from chests in Aldarin villas offers the fastest experience from level 36 until 45. Each chest gives 200 experience per successful unlock. There is a chance on failure to be teleported outside. With a lockpick between 50,000 and 60,000 experience per hour is possible; without a lockpick 40,000 to 50,000 experience per hour is more likely. Notable drops from the chest include uncut gems, herb seeds, medium clue scrolls, and blessed bone shards. The chest in the western villa offers the shortest run back from the teleport location after failing. There is some time during the runs back for fletching bolts or other downtime activities.

Levels 45–49, 65–84/91/99: Blackjacking
thumb|Blackjacking in action.
Blackjacking bandits in Pollnivneach offers the fastest experience from level 45 to 49, and then from level 65 to 84. To blackjack, lure a bandit to an empty house where the other bandits cannot see them. Knock out the bandit and pickpocket them twice while they are unconscious. When timed correctly, the player will receive experience drops every two ticks. There is a chance to fail the knock-out, in which case the player will need to quickly knock out the bandit again or pickpocket them to avoid entering into combat. If the bandit starts attacking, equip a different Melee weapon and attempt to knock out the bandit to cancel the combat.

There are three different types of bandits that can be blackjacked, but the method is the same for all of them.
 From level 45 to 55, blackjack level 41 Bearded Pollnivnian bandits who are wielding a blackjack.
 From level 55 to 65, blackjack level 56 Pollnivnian bandits who do not have a beard and are wielding a scimitar.
 From level 65 onwards, blackjack Menaphite Thugs located in the southern part of Pollnivneach.

Blackjacking requires level 45 Thieving, partial completion of The Feud, and a blackjack of any kind. The type of blackjack does not matter for blackjacking. Wearing full rogue equipment is recommended for double loot per pickpocket, though no extra experience is given. Use Saradomin brews or other inventory-blocking food (such as pies or curry) for healing. Bring the food in banknotes and unnote it at the Banknote Exchange Merchant next to the general store. Alternatively, buy jugs of wine from Faisal at the bar to the south.

The experience rates in the table below assume having decent practice and using Saradomin brews for extended trips. Expect lower rates when learning or if using worse food at lower levels. If buying jugs of wine from the bar, expect 10–15% lower rates. With good practice, it is possible to gain up to 270,000–275,000 experience per hour at level 99.

  Level XP/h 45 103,000 55 138,000 65 203,000 75 221,000 85 239,000 95 257,000 99 265,000

Stealing artefacts offers faster experience from level 49 to 65, and the Pyramid Plunder minigame past level 91, but this method remains viable up to level 99. This method is fairly click-intensive however, so players may find it easier in the long run to try other methods listed below.

If using this method from level 45 to 91, the player will make ~2,500,000 coins, or ~5,000,000 coins when wearing full rogue equipment. Rogue equipment is locked until level 50.

Resetting aggressiveness
thumb|Switching weapons to reset aggressiveness.
Failing to knock out a bandit will make them aggressive. When this happens, avoid pickpocketing a conscious bandit (without a full inventory) as getting stunned will lower experience rates. With quick enough reactions, it is possible to avoid getting into combat by doing the following:
Keep trying to knock them out again. This is the best option but requires quick reactions.
Pickpocket the bandit with a full inventory. The player will not actually pickpocket, but selecting the dialogue prompt will reset aggressiveness. You can attempt to knock-out again immediately after the dialogue prompt, even though you will appear stunned.

If the bandit starts attacking the player, the bandit cannot be pickpocketed or knocked out while in combat. The fastest reliable way to get out of combat is to unequip the blackjack or switch to a different weapon, and attempt to knock out the bandit. This will make the bandit stop attacking the player. Wait a few seconds before re-equipping the blackjack, and continue blackjacking.

More information and tips
For minimal mouse movement (similarly to training Construction), set NPC 'Attack' Options to "Hidden". Use resizable mode, zoom in, and set the camera angle so that when right-clicking on a bandit, the mouse cursor is on the "Pickpocket" option.

Lure a bandit to a spot where he gets trapped and cannot move elsewhere. Make sure the bandit is not able to walk through you; this can be done by knocking out the bandit, quickly running away from the bandit and going back in front of him. The bandit will not teleport to its respawn location as long as you keep blackjacking. One of the best houses to lure a bearded or regular Pollnivnian bandit in is Ali the Dyer's house in the northern part of Pollnivneach, which is very small and has a ladder which can be used to quickly reset aggressiveness if needed. A Menaphite Thug can be lured into the southern part of the house just next to the bar.

Having a full inventory minimises the possibility of getting stunned after pickpocketing a conscious bandit. The time saved from avoiding being stunned will significantly increase experience rates. Having full inventory does not completely prevent you pickpocketing a conscious bandit however, since even with full inventory you are able to do so on the same tick the bandit becomes conscious. If you are using Saradomin brews for healing, have the automatic vial smashing disabled so you have a full inventory after drinking the potions.

Having a maximum stack of coin pouches (must be pouches from the NPC being blackjacked) will stop the player from being able to pickpocket a conscious bandit/thug however, the action of attempting to pickpocket the after a failed knockout attempt will stop the NPC from initiating combat after the initial hit giving players a larger window of opportunity to avoid falling into combat and having to reset. (Depending on Ardougne Diary completion the coin pouch limit is 28/56/84/140) Even though obtaining a max stack of coin pouches can be somewhat time consuming it is greatly recommended at lower levels as it will greatly reduce the need to reset combat and the reduction of experience rates due to failed knock out attempts and stun's from failed pickpocket attempts trying to avoid combat.

Consider completing the blackjacking portion of Rogue Trader for the option to purchase a blackjack with defensive stats; which can help reduce damage taken from Menaphite Thugs.

Levels 49–65/99: Stealing artefacts

300px|right|thumb|Stealing artefacts in Port Piscarilius.

Stealing artefacts in Port Piscarilius offers the fastest experience from level 49 to 65. This method remains as a feasible alternative for players who prefer something less click-intensive, or for players who want to train Thieving while doing actions that can be done while moving. Such actions include fletching ammo, casting High Level Alchemy, burning logs, cutting gems, making certain potions, and baking pies with the Bake Pie spell.

To begin, lure two guards so that the bridges can be passed without being spotted. See this page for details. Once the guards have been set up, this method goes as follows:
 Talk to Captain Khaled to be assigned a house to steal from.
 Use the book of the dead/Kharedst's memoirs teleport to the Fisher's Flute, and steal the artefact from drawers inside the assigned house. A lockpick is required for this.
 Smuggle the artefact without getting caught by the guards.
 Bring the stolen artefact to Captain Khaled, and repeat. Recharge the book of the dead at the Old Memorial and restore run energy whenever needed.

Each successful heist yields Thieving experience and 500–1,000 coins. Getting caught will lower experience rates fairly notably, so it is usually better to wait for an opportune moment to sneak past the patrollers than risk getting caught.

The experience rates in the table below assume using stamina potions, the book of the dead, and guard lures. With good practice, it is possible to gain up to 270,000–280,000 experience per hour at level 99.

  level XP/h 49 150,000 55 163,000 60 174,000 65 186,000 70 197,000 75 208,000 80 219,000 85 230,000 90 241,000 95 252,000 99 261,000

Levels 84–99: Stealing from Rogues' Castle chests

Stealing from Rogues' Castle chests in the Wilderness offers the fastest Thieving experience from level 84 onwards. Because the chests are located in the deep Wilderness in a multi-combat zone, it is recommended to minimise the risk to player killers.

For this method, only bring things you are willing to lose. If you have completed the hard Wilderness Diary, the quickest way to get to Rogues' Castle is by using a Wilderness Obelisk to Level 50 Wilderness. Alternatively, bring a Knife and use the Ardougne or Edgeville lever to teleport into Deep Wilderness and slash the web north of the teleport location, then walk east till you encounter the castle. Be careful getting there, as you can encounter the Chaos Elemental, which can kill you if you are not cautious. When you reach the castle, watch out for other players, as this is a hot spot for both PKers and players doing Wilderness Slayer. The chest can be found near the north wall of the castle.

Once you are at the chest, search for traps. If you do not search for traps, you will take damage instead. When you loot the chest, rogues will become aggressive and start attacking you, so make sure you use your Protect From Melee prayer before opening the chest. Doing this will net you about 2,450,000–2,500,000 coins per hour. A looting bag is not necessary, but it is recommended.

The best strategy to avoid dying to PKers is to bring yourself to a low amount of HP by either trying to loot the chest without checking for traps or using a locator orb to damage yourself. When a PKer logs in or appears on your map, you can simply switch off your prayer and die to the Rogues instead of the PKer. Your items will be sent to your gravestone, and the PKer will not be able to take your loot. Alternatively, you can try running from the PKer by using the staircase in the castle and hopping between floors to give you enough time to log out.

Experience rates and profit varies depending on player killers. Players can gain up to around 280,000–290,000 experience per hour when including occasional deaths and not banking the loot. Banking the loot will lower the rate to around 260,000–270,000 experience per hour. When uninterrupted, it is possible to gain up to 300,000 experience per hour.

Levels 91–99: Pyramid Plunder

300px|right|thumb|Pyramid Plunder in Sophanem
The Pyramid Plunder minigame offers the fastest Thieving experience outside of the Wilderness from level 91 onwards. The strategy for Thieving experience is to loot the golden chest and all the urns in the last room, the golden chests along the way, and some urns in the second-to-last room if there is time. Players can begin training at Pyramid Plunder at level 71 or 81 as an alternative method to blackjacking or stealing artefacts, however, the experience rates are much lower before level 91.

Players will need to have access to Sophanem by having started the quest Icthlarin's Little Helper, or using a pharaoh's sceptre teleport to Jalsavrah. High-healing food (such as Saradomin brews), some stamina potions, and some form of antipoison (preferably araxyte venom sacks to save inventory space) are needed inside the pyramid. For the highest experience rates, players will also need a charged pharaoh's sceptre for a direct teleport to the guardian mummy and noted artefacts for recharging it. Completing task sets in the Desert Diary will increase the amount of charges the pharaoh's sceptre can hold. Should the player not be able to get a pharaoh's sceptre, completing Contact! is recommended to access the bank near the pyramid. Otherwise, the player would have to travel back to a bank far from Sophanem every time they need more supplies.

While training, players may loot a pharaoh's sceptre from the golden chests. It can be sold for profit or kept for use. Banking the artefacts is not recommended as this would greatly lower experience rates, and the artefacts are not very valuable. However, the golden artefacts can recharge the pharaoh's sceptre.

The experience rates in the table below assume soloing and using the pharaoh's sceptre teleport. Higher rates can be achieved by having a duo partner or an alternative account. It takes approximately 335 games to get from 91 to 99 in Pyramid Plunder.

  levels XP/h 71–80 125,000 81–90 190,000 91+ 270,000

Other methods
Levels 1–5: Men/Women
From level 1 to 5, pickpocket men or women around RuneScape. Players who have their respawn point in Lumbridge can do so around Lumbridge Castle and simply die to regain Hitpoints. Alternatively, a man by the Draynor Village Agility Course start can be trapped inside the house so that he will stay in place. Reaching level 5 takes 49 successful pickpockets.

Levels 5–25: Bakery stalls
From level 5 to 25, steal from the eastern bakery stall in East Ardougne market. Stand under the baker to avoid getting caught by the guards, and drop the loot. Players can gain up to 19,200 experience per hour. Tea and silk stalls offer worse experience rates than bakery stalls due to slower respawns.
thumb|Safespot for the bakery stall in East Ardougne.

Levels 25–50: Fruit stalls
From level 25 to 50, steal from fruit stalls in Hosidius. The best place to do this is in the easternmost house near the beach (see the map), which has 2 stalls close to each other and no guard dogs patrolling nearby. Steal from both stalls as fast as possible and drop the fruit while running between them. Eat the strange fruits or use stamina potions to restore run energy. Players can gain up to 42,750 experience per hour, or 34,200 experience per hour if stealing only from one stall.

right|thumb|250px|The fruit stall found in front of Logava, with the guard dogs trapped between the wooden supports.
If banking the fruits, steal from the stall at the Hosidius market. Bring 15–20 baskets and fill them to fit more fruits per trip. The guard dogs can be corner-trapped by luring them slightly north and then standing directly south of the stall (see the image). However, if only banking the golovanova fruit tops, using the two stalls east of the market is recommended for faster experience rates.

Levels 50–99: Stealing valuables in Varlamore

thumb|400px|A map showing the relevant areas for the activity.
Stealing valuables in Civitas illa Fortis is a low-effort alternative to the faster methods, allowing for significant AFK time. This method requires level 50 Thieving and completion of Children of the Sun. A chisel is optional to break down some of the loot.

To begin, pickpocket wealthy citizens at the bazaar for house keys. A street urchin will occasionally distract a wealthy citizen, which guarantees successful pickpockets and the player will automatically pickpocket them for around 20 seconds. This method alone can give 55k xp per hour with minimal effort (due to pickpocketing happening automatically for those 20 seconds followed by a wait period), or up to 95k xp per hour when hopping worlds with higher effort. Players should collect approximately 20 keys for every 1 hour of burglary they anticipate, which will take around 30 minutes with minimal effort, or 15 minutes if wearing a full set of rogue equipment which doubles the house keys stolen.

Now enter one of the three houses available to be burgled. The burglable house is indicated by a closed door and the absence of the owner. Each cycle lasts around 3 minutes, beginning with a homeowner leaving the house and ending with their return. Steal from the furniture (chests, jewellery cases, and wardrobes) for 45 Thieving experience per steal, and to obtain valuables and other loot. Valuables stack in the inventory and will continue to be looted automatically for about 1 minute.

A flashing arrow will occasionally appear above one of the objects. Searching this furniture grants 14 valuables and 630 Thieving experience, and then the player will continue to loot it with normal rates. If not searched within about 8 seconds, the opportunity will vanish.

When the homeowner is returning (signaled by an urchin whistling), exit the house through the open window. If caught by the homeowner after they unlock their door, the player will lose most of the looted valuables from that house and be teleported a short distance away.

Estimated experience rates for stealing valuables are shown in the table below; these rates do not take into account the time spent collecting the keys. Players can expect to gain around  per hour from trading in the valuables to Oriana, plus an additional  in jewellery and around 3 blessed bone statuettes which can be chiseled into 125 blessed bone shards each for some passive Prayer experience. Getting the gladiator rank at the Fortis Colosseum increases the profit from the valuables to around  per hour. Rogue equipment will not increase the valuables obtained.

  level XP/h 50 72,000 60 80,000 70 93,000 80 95,000 90 100,000  99 105,000

Levels 25/85–99: Underwater
With the completion of Bone Voyage and access to the Fossil Island, underwater thieving (also known as "swimming") becomes available.

Unlike most other training methods, it focuses on training two skills at once, Thieving and Agility, and while it is slower Thieving experience than other listed methods, the rate at which both skills are trained makes it efficient overall at some levels. Due to the rate scaling per level, both Thieving and Agility levels play a part in whether the method is worth it over alternatives. However, it tends to become consistently efficient from level 85 Thieving onwards. Alternatively, the experience can be gained in either Thieving or Agility rather than both, but this is generally inefficient due to the scaling used.

Levels 55–99: Knights of Ardougne
thumb|Using different items, or completing the medium Ardougne Diary tasks will change experience rates.
Pickpocketing Knights of Ardougne is a slower but more straightforward alternative to the faster training methods. A knight can be lured so that the player can continuously pickpocket them without moving the mouse. The player will occasionally need to open the coin pouches to continue pickpocketing.

Completing the medium Ardougne Diary is strongly recommended for a 10% higher success rate of pickpocketing. Use dodgy necklaces to have a 25% chance to resist being stunned and taking damage, which increases experience rates slightly. Wearing full rogue equipment grants double loot per pickpocket, though no extra experience is given. With completion of A Kingdom Divided, Shadow Veil can be used for an extra chance to resist the stun, stacking with dodgy necklaces for a total of 36.25%, though shadow veil starts to lose value around level 90. If using shadow veil, players should bring a lava staff and a stack of cosmic runes.  

The experience rates in the table below assume the player has completed the medium Ardougne Diary and is using dodgy necklaces. The rates also assume some time is spent on mistakes and opening the coin pouches. Players stop failing to pickpocket Knights of Ardougne at level 95 with the medium diary perk, from which point onwards the tick-perfect rate is 252,900 experience per hour. 

  level XP/h 55 86,000 60 98,000 65 109,000 70 124,000 75 141,000 80 159,000 85 182,000 90 209,000 95 240,000

Training from level 55 to level 99 on Knights of Ardougne would yield around  without rogue equipment, and roughly  with the full set. Players can expect to use roughly 200 dodgy necklaces and need to heal 16,000 hitpoints worth of damage (with natural regeneration taken into account at 1x hitpoints restore rate) from level 55 to 95.

Players can often find someone splashing a knight in the south bank on the following worlds, with many players taking part in pickpocketing the targeted knight.

 World  Location  Members  Activity

Lure north of the market
thumb|left|An example of a trapped knight, with highlighted which tile to start shoving from, as well as a knight in the resulting trap.
Attack a knight located in the south-eastern part of the Ardougne marketplace and lure him towards the building to the north of the marketplace. Go stand in the doorway of that building so that the knight is standing south next to you. Run two squares west so the knight should stand east of you. Then run into the square south of the doorway so the knight will stand on the doorway. Use the dragon spear's special attacks on the knight, and quickly run inside and close the door before the knight is able to walk back outside. You can also walk under the knight to force it to walk backwards but it may take a few attempts for it to walk the right direction. After waiting a while, the knight will move to most southern squares of the house and he will only be able to move between those two squares. If he is able to move elsewhere, you have lured a wrong knight and you will have to do this once again.

Players can also simply hop worlds until you find one where the knight has already been lured.

After the knight has been lured correctly, go stand north of him. Turn your camera west and all the way down, and zoom in. This way you are able to spam-click the same spot (around the chest) to pickpocket. It is important that you do not stand on any of the squares he is able to walk on, as he will get stuck and will despawn after 5 minutes of stationary activity.

Lure south of the market
thumb|220px|The starting square to place the knights, using the dragon spear special attack to trap him in the building, with the other knight already trapped.
thumb|220px|Two Ardougne knights trapped by the docks. The camera here is vertical for clarity, but when Thieving should be rotated to be more level with the floor.
This lure involves trapping two knights south-east of the southern bank. The benefit of this technique is that it does not require a second account to splash and, once set up, the player does not need to move their mouse, even to open coin pouches. The knights will also not despawn and thus it does not need to be set up again.

To do this technique, a dragon spear or zamorakian hasta and runes for Snare or Entangle are required. Also the player must have their Game client layout set to "Resizable - Modern layout" to allow the menus to be minimized.

 Attack one of the two knights found in the southern half of the market and lure it to the square shown (right), preferably with a fun weapon to not risk killing him.
 Bind the knight with snare/entangle.
 Use the dragon spear special attack 3 times until the knight is just north of the door, taking care to make sure you only attack the knight from his northern side.
 If the snare has expired, snare him again and then open the door, push the knight one more time with the dragon spear special attack and close the door behind him.
 Run south to ensure that the knight is no longer aggressive
 Restore your special attack energy either by waiting a few minutes or using a restoration pool or better in your player-owned house.
 Repeat steps 1–5 with the second knight.
 Once the two knights are trapped in the building, use the second door to the east and stand to the south of the knights.
 Set your camera facing west and all the way down, placing your coin pouch in a spot in your inventory that overlaps with the knights, which may vary based on your window size and ratio, bring placeholder items to ensure it always goes to this spot.
 Change your settings; by clicking options, Advanced options and enable side-panels so that you can open and close your inventory with your set F-key (enabling mouse keys is also recommended).
 Place your cursor over the coin pouch and keep it here, close your inventory using your F-key and pickpocket the knight.

By following these steps, with your inventory closed you can pickpocket the eastern knight as it moves between the two tiles without moving your mouse. When you need to open your coin pouch, simply open your inventory and your coin pouch should be under your cursor. By remaining one square south of the two knights, they will never despawn.

Splashing
Another option is to use a splashing account to keep a knight into place. This can be done anywhere if the splashing account simply tanks the knight, but this requires having high Defence and wearing good defensive armour along with the Hitpoints cape and regen bracelet. Alternatively, lure a knight to a spot where the splasher is able to safespot the knight, such as in the south-eastern bank of Ardougne where it is possible to use the fences as blockades. The knight will not despawn as long as he is aggressive towards the splasher, and the splashing account stays logged in if it is attacking or tanking the knight. Splashing is performed on "sticky knights," a term to describe a knight that moves a lot less as it has been forced out of it's natural wander range. This will always be a female knight for the south bank.

Players can also bring a stack of law runes and a staff giving unlimited water runes instead of food to make the process more simple. After death two law runes and the staff will be kept, enabling the player to quickly teleport back to the Ardougne marketplace. Pick up your coins and stack of law runes off the ground and continue pickpocketing. Enabling Rapid Heal can help extend trips longer.

Levels 78–99: Dorgesh-Kaan rich chests
thumb|Dorgesh-Kaan rich chests are marked in red and average chests marked in green.
Stealing from the rich chests in Dorgesh-Kaan is a fairly low-effort alternative that offers decent experience. Enter one of the two houses in Dorgesh-Kaan that contain two rich chests. Open both chests with a lockpick for Thieving experience and loot, and hop worlds. Drop or bank the loot for more inventory space when needed. The chest loot will respawn after 5 minutes, which equates to roughly 13–15 world hops.

To access Dorgesh-Kaan, players must have completed Death to the Dorgeshuun. A lockpick is required to open the chests. If banking the loot, bring the gem bag if available and some form of run energy restoration.

Without banking, players can expect to gain up to 210,000–230,000 experience per hour providing there are not many other players hopping between worlds (assuming 340 chests per hour; 170 worlds). When banking the loot, players can expect to gain around 190,000 experience and 300,000 coins per hour.

Levels 1–99: Sorceress's Garden

The Sorceress's Garden minigame consists of navigating through a maze while avoiding guardians to pick fruit and squeeze them into juice. A pestle and mortar is used to squeeze the fruit into juice and a beer glass is used to hold the squeezed juice. Beer glasses can be bought from the Grand Exchange. Only one sq'irk can be obtained per trip through a garden.

To unlock access to the Sorceress’s garden, talk to Osman in front of the palace about sq'irk juice. He is also the one to whom you trade your glasses of sq'irk juice in return for Thieving experience.

Experience rates are unknown for some of the lower level gardens. Sorceress's Summer Garden (requiring 65 Thieving) provides a maximum of 150,000 per hour, however 'realistic' experience rates are closer to 140,000 experience per hour, given the need to bank the sq'irk once inventory is full. 

Other potential benefits of this method include a modest amount of passive Farming experience, and a minimal amount of passive Cooking experience. Additionally, if using a "one-click" method to traverse the summer garden, there is a considerable amount of running time between actions which can either be used to AFK, or (for a minimal loss in Thieving experience rate) to "zero-time" train another skill such as Magic or Fletching.

  levels Garden Notes 1–25 Winter Requiring 5 sq'irks to make one glass of juice, each glass of winter sq'irkjuice turned in rewards 350 Thieving experience. 25–45 Spring Requiring 4 sq'irks to make one glass of juice, each glass of spring sq'irkjuice turned in rewards 1,350 Thieving experience. 45–65 Autumn Requiring 3 sq'irks to make one glass of juice, each glass of autumn sq'irkjuice turned in rewards 2,350 Thieving experience. 65–99 Summer Requiring only 2 sq'irks to make one glass of juice, each glass of summer sq'irkjuice turned in rewards 3,000 Thieving experience. At level 65, 4,196 glasses of juice are required to make it to level 99. This translates to 8,392 trips through the Summer Garden.

Level 82–99: Pickpocketing vyres
Pickpocketing vyres at level 82 with rogue equipment, dodgy necklaces, and the hard Ardougne Diary completed will get 120,000–180,000 experience per hour and profit  coins per hour, depending on Thieving level. This will require completion of the Sins of the Father.

As an alternative to using food, players may opt to use prayer regeneration potions in conjunction with the Redemption prayer. As the vyres inflict a flat 5 health points worth of damage, the prayer should be activated by at least 6 health points.

Level 85–99: Pickpocketing elves
Pickpocketing elves in Prifddinas is a slower but profitable alternative after completing Song of the Elves. The elves in Prifddinas yield enhanced crystal teleport seeds which can be sold for high profit. 

At level 99 players can gain around 150,000 experience per hour and  coins per hour assuming that players use dodgy necklaces, and full rogue equipment.

Levels 94–99: Master Farmers
At level 94 and after completing the hard Ardougne Diary, players can pickpocket Master Farmers at 100% success rate. They yield ranarr and snapdragon seeds, which can be sold for very high profit. The rates for ranarr, snapdragon, and torstol seeds scales with the Farming level, up to level 85 Farming. Having at least level 75 Farming is recommended. Even though Master Farmers become available at level 38 Thieving, pickpocketing them at lower levels offers poor experience rates and profit due to high fail rates.

The best location to pickpocket a Master Farmer is in the house east of the Outer Fortis General Store, south-east of Civitas illa Fortis. Talk to the Master Farmer inside to keep her in place, or lure her to a tile where she cannot move elsewhere.

Players can gain up to 115,000–120,000 experience per hour.

Level 99+: TzHaar-Hur

thumb|The roaming TzHaar-Hur at the sourthern part of Mor Ul Rek near the TzHaar-Hur-Rin's Ore and Gem Store is trapped in this alcove (with the Shove special attack) and cannot move north.
Pickpocketing TzHaar-Hur in the inner part of Mor Ul Rek is a viable option past level 99. Similarly to Knights of Ardougne, TzHaar-Hur can be lured into a spot where they cannot move on more than two tiles, allowing the player to repeatedly left-click to pickpocket them. As their loot does not include coins, the only other required interaction is healing and optionally replacing the dodgy necklace. This makes pickpocketing TzHaar-Hur much less attention-demanding than Knights of Ardougne, although with higher requirements.

For this method, players will need to wear the Thieving cape and have completed the hard Ardougne Diary for increased pickpocket chance. The Thieving cape and the hard Ardougne Diary perks stack, which makes this method viable. Even though this method becomes available at level 90, it is generally not worth doing without the Thieving cape bonus, as this would lower experience rates a lot.

Accessing the inner part of Mor Ul Rek requires having a fire cape. Players must wear ice gloves to be able to pickpocket the TzHaar-Hur. Wearing a dodgy necklace is also strongly recommended. Bring Saradomin brews and spare dodgy necklaces to extend trips. Wearing rogue equipment (excluding the gloves) is recommended for increased Tokkul and gems.

If banking the gems, having a gem bag is strongly recommended, as gems are automatically stored there if it is open. Otherwise, they will fall to the floor if the inventory is full. Players are advised to take 3 dodgy necklaces and 3–4 Saradomin brews for each trip when banking the gems. A trip will last around 45 minutes.

At level 99 Thieving, players can gain up to around 250,000–260,000 experience per hour. Banking the gems would lower the rate to around 240,000 experience per hour.

===== Pay-to-play Crafting training =====
Crafting training methods usually cost money and require a lot of capital to buy the supplies needed. Prices of materials will fluctuate, so check the Grand Exchange prices before buying and selling them in large quantities.

Starting off
There are plenty of quests that give Crafting experience upon completion, which allows the player to skip a lot of early Crafting training. If the player is going to complete them anyway, it is best to do as early as possible since the experience rewards benefit more at lower levels as the training methods are slower.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–20: Leather items
From level 1 to 20, craft the highest-level leather item available. Leather currently costs  each and all items only require one leather to craft. In order to craft any leather items, you need a needle and some thread. Since each thread is good for around 5 uses, to get to level 20 with this method, you will need around 50 thread.

 LevelLeather itemXP neededTotal cost1–713.8487–916.2199–1118.52111–14223414–202595Total217
This will require a total of 217 leather, for a total cost of . Every leather item is created in 3 ticks (1.8 seconds), so the total creation time for all 217 leather items is 651 ticks (390.6 seconds).

Levels 20–62/77/99: Cutting gems
Cutting (uncut) gems offers the fastest experience up to level 77. However, cutting dragonstones is much more expensive compared to the lower-level gems, so it is recommended to keep cutting diamonds until level 62 and continue with fire battlestaves. Depending on the prices, it may be worthwhile to also skip cutting diamonds, and cut rubies until level 58 and continue with earth battlestaves.

Even though onyxes offer faster experience, they are not viable due to incredibly high cost and limited supply.

The experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The rates assume players cut 2,780 gems per hour.

 LevelGemXPXP/h# to nextGE PriceGP/XPUncutCutDiff20501062767.5156348535543107.51,08255Dragonstone137.5( 62) 1,216( 77) 9,520

Levels 54–77/99: Battlestaves
Crafting battlestaves offers relatively fast experience and is usually cheaper compared to other methods. While this method is usually relatively cheap, buying the supplies requires a lot of capital.

Fire and air battlestaves have comparable experience rates to green and blue d'hide bodies, respectively, so choose based on the Grand Exchange prices. Green and blue d'hide bodies require a lot less capital.

Players who have completed tiers of the Varrock Diary may also purchase noted battlestaves daily from Zaff for a reduced price. This will save  per battlestaff compared to purchasing them from the Grand Exchange.

Crafting d'hide bodies becomes considerably faster at level 77 and even more so at level 84, but air battlestaves remain as a good cheaper alternative.

The experience rates shown in the table below assume 2,450 battlestaves crafted per hour. Expect lower rates if idling. With perfect banking, it is possible to craft up to 2,625 battlestaves per hour. High Level Alchemy can be cast on the battlestaves later to reduce costs while also gaining passive Magic experience. If including the time taken to cast High Level Alchemy, only 800 battlestaves can be made and alched per hour.

Levels 63/77–99: D'hide bodies
Crafting d'hide bodies becomes the fastest viable training method from level 77 onwards. Players can begin crafting green d'hide bodies at level 63, or blue d'hide bodies at level 71 as an alternative method to cutting gems or crafting battlestaves.

Use the costume needle to craft 9 d'hide bodies per inventory. The player can obtain one from the Costumer in Aldarin after completing Death on the Isle. Without the costume needle the player will need thread to craft d'hide bodies, which only allows making 8 d'hide bodies per inventory and will lower experience rates slightly.

Turn on deposit lock in the bank menu to bank efficiently. This allows the player to only deposit d'hide bodies with the 'Deposit inventory' button without depositing the costume needle.

The player can use tick manipulation to start the crafting process one tick faster. To do this, have an alternative account to lure aggressiveness of a gnome at the Gnome Stronghold south bank. Position the gnome so that they stand on an adjacent tile to the bank booth. Equip a shortbow without ammo and set the attack option to Rapid. When banking, quickly attempt to attack the gnome before using the needle on a leather. This will skip the stall from making the first item when done correctly, which will increase experience rates slightly.

Green and blue d'hide bodies offer comparable experience rates to fire and air battlestaves, respectively. Choose whichever is cheaper. However, green and blue d'hide bodies require a lot less capital. Black d'hide bodies offer the fastest experience but they are typically much more expensive compared to other methods, so look into cheaper alternatives if seeking to save money.

The experience rates in the table below assume good banking and paying attention. Expect lower rates if idling or making mistakes with banking. With tick manipulation, players can craft up to 1,860 d'hide bodies per hour. Without tick manipulation, it is possible to craft up to 1,800 d'hide bodies per hour when using the costume needle. High Level Alchemy can be cast on the d'hide bodies later to reduce costs while also gaining passive Magic experience. The High Level Alchemy prices assume a staff of fire or equivalent is used. If including the time taken to cast high alchemy, only about 700 d'hide bodies can be made and alched per hour.

Other methods
Levels 1–83/99: Molten glass
Blowing molten glass with a glassblowing pipe offers very slow experience rates, but it requires little attention and a low amount of capital. Most low-level items are not viable due to high cost, but certain higher-level ones, such as unpowered orbs, may be very cheap depending on the prices. Consider making money through other means and training with faster methods, such as cutting low-level gems.

Levels 5–99: Crafting jewellery
Starting at level 5, players can begin crafting gold jewellery using a gold bar and the appropriate mould at a furnace. The type of jewellery crafted depends on the mould used, with rings, necklaces, amulets, and bracelets being the primary options.

The best location for crafting is Prifddinas, as it features the shortest distance between a bank and a furnace. If you do not have access to Prifddinas, Edgeville is the next best option. Another alternative is the Shilo Village furnace, which is even closer to the bank than Edgeville’s but requires a 20gp fee per use (players can deposit bulk payments in the coffer for convenience).

If available, wearing weight-reducing clothing will help reduce run energy drain, making trips more efficient. At higher crafting levels, certain jewellery items, such as dragonstone can be profitable, though they tend to be traded in lower quantities.

Zenyte and Onyx jewellery were not included because their profit margins are often inaccurate, they would also require an immense cash down to buy in bulk. Zenytes are also just rarely sold on the Grand Exchange. 

The following rates used for experience per hour are  for a gem and metal bar,  for just metal bars, or  for a gem and metal bar with stringing.

 ItemXP/hourMaterialsProfit/LossGP/hourLevelExp1101635224527552759133225542960347034741635327038754580458451562072583083420402255236024652469275529603065317031743470407542805085508943855690589570100701045510072105741108015080154

Levels 26–46/99: Crafting drift nets
Drift nets can be crafted from 2 jute fibre each. About 1,000 can be made per hour for 60,000 experience per hour and  coins per hour when using the loom and bank chest at Fossil Island's Museum Camp. This is better experience per hour compared to glassblowing until 46 Crafting, which unlocks unpowered orbs. It nets  coins per experience gained. This is a potential money making method, though check Grand Exchange prices and volume before attempting it.

Levels 61–99: Casting Superglass Make
Players who have 77 Magic (can be boosted) and have completed Lunar Diplomacy, which requires 61 Crafting along with other requirements (cannot boost from lower levels to complete), can cast Superglass Make with the lunar spellbook. With Superglass Make, players can convert an inventory of buckets of sand with soda ash, seaweed, giant seaweed (recommended), or swamp weed into molten glass, granting 78 Magic experience as well as Crafting experience (180 Crafting experience per inventory with 18 buckets of sand and 3 giant seaweed or 130 Crafting experience per inventory with 13 buckets of sand with 13 of any other compatible item) and players can profit from selling molten glass or use the created molten glass for additional Crafting experience without much of a loss.

For this training method, astral runes (2 astral runes per cast), 3 giant seaweed, and 18 buckets of sand will be needed per inventory while equipped with either a smoke battlestaff or an air battlestaff with tome of fire. On average, it will make 1.3 glass for regular seaweed, soda ash, or swamp weed, or up to 1.6 glass per sand with giant seaweed.

With moderate focus, 600 casts per hour is achievable, with up to 850 being attainable at peak efficiency, achieving 108,000–153,000 Crafting and 46,800–66,300 Magic experience per hour from giant seaweed while making a good amount of profit. Withdraw 18 buckets of sand and 3 giant seaweed, close the bank, cast Superglass Make, and then bank them within a few ticks before the end of the animation. For the best experience and money-making rates, ignore any dropped glass, as this will still yield 0.15 extra molten glass per bucket of sand compared to regular seaweed or other compatible item.

 Level 52-99 Fixing goblin lamps in Dorgesh-Kaan 

Lamps can be fixed in Dorgesh-Kaan for both crafting and firemaking experience. This requires completion of The Lost Tribe and level 52 crafting and firemaking. Each lamp requires a light orb to fix. The light orbs can be purchased on the Grand Exchange or crafted yourself, however crafting the complete light orbs requires level 87 crafting.

Around ten lamps will be broken at any one time, and are unique to each player; each player will see different lamps around Dorgesh-Kaan as broken. 

Fixing the lamps yields an average of 550 crafting and 550 firemaking experience. The player instead receives an additional of 174 crafting experience per lamp if crafting the light orbs — 70 for blowing the glass and 104 for adding the wire, though this takes longer.

The player receives 500 firemaking and 500 crafting experience each time a lamp is fixed. For every 50 lamps fixed, the player will receive an additional 2,500 experience in both crafting and firemaking. Upon fixing a lamp, should the player still be carrying additional light orbs afterwards, they will be notified whether there is another lamp in need of fixing nearby. This will be accompanied by a flashing arrow on their minimap if so. Light orbs can be thieved from the chests in Dorgesh-kaan, but in relatively low numbers.

Skilled players can reach 130,000 crafting experience and 100,000 firemaking experience per hour, if making the light orbs. 

While still learning, players should expect as low as 90,000 crafting experience per hour. 

The average chest and rich chest are both found in high numbers on the route and can grant additional light orbs. The chests grant 200 thieving experience and 650 thieving experience per successful attempt, respectively. This will mean the player gains less crafting experience, but more thieving experience and extra cave goblin wire from both chest types, and empty light orbs and light orbs from the rich chests.  

 Items required 

 Light orbs filling most of the inventory, with more in the bank. These can be bought on the grand exchange.
 Empty light orbs or molten glass with a glassblowing pipe if making your own light orbs. This requires 87 crafting. The player will also need cave goblin wire for each light orb, which can be thieved nearby at the wire machine with 44 thieving.
 Stamina potion and low-weight equipment such as the Graceful outfit. The ring of endurance may be beneficial here.
 Lockpicks if thieving the chests

 Making your own light orbs 
See the light orb page for more detailed information. 

Players should take an inventory of empty light orbs to the wire machine. Either craft the empty light orbs ahead of time or take an inventory of molten glass and craft it while running to the wire machine. Once there, fill all of the light orbs with cave wire. Then, either work clockwise or counterclockwise around the city fixing lamps. After fixing a lamp at the bank, grab more items from the bank and start again. Every time the player fixes a lamp, the game will indicate where a nearby broken lamp is. Because only one lamp location is given, players should also keep an eye out for other nearby lamps that can also be repaired and prioritise lamps in an order that requires the least amount of backtracking. Whenever there are no nearby lamps, using a Dorgesh-kaan sphere to teleport to a random location in the city can help to reach another broken lamp quickly.

Levels 83–99: Cutting amethyst
Cutting amethyst into ranging material with a chisel will often yield very small losses (or even profits) while also granting more experience than glassblowing, making it a viable method for those who are willing to sacrifice the speed of other methods for cheaper (or profitable) Crafting experience.

===== Free-to-play Crafting training =====
This guide outlines the best methods and alternative options for training the Crafting skill in free-to-play.

Quests that reward Crafting experience
Sheep Shearer: 150 Crafting experience
Goblin Diplomacy: 200 Crafting experience
Misthalin Mystery: 600 Crafting experience

Completing all of these quests will provide enough experience to level up Crafting from level 1 to level 8.

Potter's wheel, spinning wheel and furnace locations
Barbarian Village has a potter's wheel medium distance to closest bank (West Varrock bank). No clay rocks or water source nearby. 

 Varrock south-west mine to Varrock west bank is a good place to mine clay.
 Waterpump (Falador) to Falador west bank is the closest water source to a bank. Water fountain in centre of Varrock square to Varrock west bank is also a good water source close to a bank.

Lumbridge bank to the spinning wheel downstairs is a good combination for a bank plus spinning wheel.

Edgeville has the furnace closest to a bank for crafting silver or gold. Al Kharid bank to a furnace is a decent location for a relatively short distance between bank and furnace, for crafting silver and gold.

Upon reaching Crafting Level 40, the Crafting Guild has no bank nearby, but contains clay rocks, a water source , a potter's wheel, and a pottery kiln. The crafting guild also has  two spinning wheels. A flock of wool-producing sheep can be found just a short walk north of the guild.
Ultimate Ironman
Until level 40, ultimate ironmen can mine clay in West Varrock mine, canoe up to Edgeville and use the well as a water source, then walk down to Barbarian Village wheel and kiln, then boat back down to Champions' Guild/West Varrock mine. Yields 650–720 experience per run, depending on the amount of open inventory spaces.

After level 40, use the Crafting Guild. Mining and smelting gold, crafting them into jewellery to sell at Grum's Gold Exchange. is a good way to make money while training Mining, Crafting and Smithing as an Ultimate Ironman.

Common training methods
In-Place Training Methods
These methods do not require any moving, and thus can be performed at the Grand Exchange or in a Bank (assuming you have already gathered the necessary resources).

Players have been observed cutting gems with the help of banknotes to make training more efficient. It requires the player to convert non-stackable uncut gems into notes from a bank. Then use the noted uncut gems on the bank/teller to receive gems for cutting; cut the resulting un-noted uncut gems with a chisel. Deposit cut gems into a deposit box; un-note more uncut gems from the noted uncut gems stack in inventory via bank/teller; repeating this process until the desired level is reached. Corsair Cove is a great place for this method because the bank and deposit box are 2 ticks away from each other, reducing time spent walking and manually depositing/withdrawing items to and from the bank. This method actually helps to offset the loss of potential experience per hour by cutting less expensive gems due to all the entities required for cutting being in such close proximity.

Miscellaneous

For the purposes of crafting jewellery, Edgeville furnace is the closest furnace to a bank.

Stringing Amulets
Combining a ball of wool with one of many types of unstrung amulets.  This action can be performed anywhere, requires no skills or equipment, and is very fast (only takes two ticks).  Each amulet strung awards 4 crafting experience, regardless of what is being strung.  When near a bank, it is possible to string 2500 amulets per hour, awarding 10,000 XP.  Also, the Grand Exchange can make this a profitable endeavor:

===== Fletching training =====
This article gives tips about training the Fletching skill.

Starting off
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Fletching experience. Completing Animal Magnetism, Big Chompy Bird Hunting and Zogre Flesh Eaters will grant a total of 3,262 Fletching experience, which will get the player up to level 18. These quests have few requirements and can be done at a low level. Completing Temple of Ikov and The Fremennik Trials will grant an additional 10,812 Fletching experience, which will get the player up to level 30.

Fletching can be trained entirely while doing other activities, meaning that the skill may be trained passively in "zero time". Activities which involve a lot of running or have downtime, and do not require full inventory space are well-suited for Fletching training, such as questing, training Agility, training Hunter (excluding black salamanders and black chinchompas), farm runs, training Slayer, subduing Wintertodt etc.

Darts
Fletching darts is arguably the most feasible option for zero time training. Fletching them only requires two clicks per a set of darts, offers high experience per action, and does not interrupt movement. Dart tips also have a steady supply on the Grand Exchange. However, this method can be expensive and may require a large amount of capital to buy all the dart tips and feathers needed. Most common and usually the cheapest options are amethyst, mithril, or adamant.

Some methods for Fletching darts include:
Simply clicking very quickly between the stack of darts and feathers.
Click on the darts or feathers to Use them, then double-click the other item on all subsequent clicks. This will complete the first Use action and immediately highlight the next item to Use again.
Playing on the mobile version, using two fingers to quickly tap feathers and dart tips one after another. It is possible to fletch 2–4 sets of darts per tick or more this way. This method is also easier for zero-time as the user's offhand can be used for clicks elsewhere for movement and other actions, whereas a mouse would need to move between the inventory and the rest of the screen.
While not useful for zero-time, darts can have a Make-X menu enabled with the in-game settings menu, which allows them to automatically make up to 10 sets of darts per action, for a less click-intensive method.

The Tourist Trap quest is not required to fletch darts, only for smithing dart tips.

Note that some players may have to change an account setting to allow two-click dart fletching, as the default setting is to use the crafting menu since the Easter 2023 update.

Bolts
Fletching bolts (attaching feathers to unfinished bolts) works similarly to darts, but it offers less experience per action compared to darts, and some options aren't viable due to low supply or low buy limits.

Semi-zero time methods
Some methods of Fletching training can be done running or in between other activities but create products at a constant rate, rather than darts or bolts which give experience every two clicks and can be made quickly. The actions are done every two game ticks (1.2 seconds) and in sets of 10 or 15, requiring periodic requeueing to make another set. These methods open a dialogue window upon creation which can delay the actions, making them less feasible for actions like Agility where there is constant interruption, but are still useful.

Tipping bolts
Some options are not viable due to low supply, low trade volume of material or product, or low buy limits, and often require a large amount of capital.

Adding tips to dragon bolts can be more profitable, but requires a large amount of capital, and some options are not viable due to low supply, low trade volume of material or product, or low buy limits.

Vale Totems
Vale Totems is a Fletching minigame that offers significantly more experience per log than fletching alone. Participating requires completion of the Vale Totems miniquest.

Eight totem sites can be found scattered around Auburn Valley. Each totem must be carved using a log and knife, then decorated with 4 fletching products of the same type of wood. Oak, willow, maple, yew, magic, and redwood logs can be used, and the supported decorations are shortbows, longbows, their unstrung variants, crossbow stocks, shields, and (in the case of redwood) hiking staves.

The numbers below assume that a player is starting only with logs on each loop, and fletching/stringing during the run to the first totem. A fletching knife reduces the time it takes to fletch a bow from 3 ticks to 2. A bow string spool allows for stringing bows with the use of only one additional inventory space, though the extra time required for stringing reduces overall XP/hr. 

Partial loop
Players who haven't yet acquired a log basket only have enough inventory space to build 5 totems per loop. 25 logs are required per loop. 

Note that with yew logs and above, partial loops will be constrained by the time it takes totems to degrade.

Other methods

Level 1–5: Headless arrows
A profitable way of training Fletching is to fletch headless arrows using arrow shafts and feathers. This grants 15 experience per action, for 1 experience per headless arrow fletched.

 Level 1–5/10: Arrow shafts 
 The best way to get from level 1 to level 5 is by fletching arrow shafts, which give 5 experience per log.

Level 5–99: Bows
Making bows is a slower, less intensive method of training fletching that is usually cheap or profitable. Fletching unstrung bows is more AFK-able but yields less experience per hour, stringing bows is faster but requires paying more attention. Since fletching unstrung bows takes 3-ticks per bow, fletching an inventory takes 48.6 seconds; stringing bows takes 2-ticks per bow which makes an inventory take 16.8 seconds to string. If using the Fletching knife to fletch unstrung bows, expect close to the same xp rates as stringing, as the knife fletches in 2-ticks instead of 3. This results in approximately 2,700 bows fletched per hour, compared to 1,800 without the knife.

Using a Bow string spool when stringing bows allows 27 bows to be strung per inventory instead of 14, reducing banking. This gives a slight increase to experience per hour (about 3%) but does not significantly change the rates shown in the table.

 Fletching battlestaves requires one piece of Celastrus bark, and yields 80 experience per bark.

===== Slayer training =====
thumb|x200px|right|Slayer master Duradel.
Slayer is a skill that allows players to kill monsters that may otherwise be immune to damage. Players must visit a Slayer Master, who will assign them a task to kill certain monsters. Slayer experience is roughly equal to a slain monster's Hitpoints and is awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster.

This guide focuses on the fastest ways to train Slayer. While there are no real requirements to begin Slayer training, it is strongly recommended to have fairly high combat stats and to have completed many quests. This enables the ability to block more undesired Slayer assignments (known as "block slots," which are applied using the "block task" option for 100 Slayer points, and have quest point requirements). High combat stats increase damage output considerably and allow the player to use the best equipment available. Having a higher combat level also gives access to better Slayer Masters, as the low-level Slayer Masters have worse task lists and give fewer Slayer reward points than the higher-level ones. Alternatively, players may choose to train combat stats while in the process of training Slayer.

When slaying for the best experience rates, players will generally want to stick in multicombat areas such as the Catacombs of Kourend. Stacking high level Slayer monsters and hitting them with multi target damage, typically with barrage spells, but also with chins and dihn's bulwark special attacks. This will result in the best damage per second, and thus Slayer experience rates. Against 1x1 and 2x2 monsters, such as araxytes, the dwarf multicannon and venator bow will compete with barrage task rates.  When neither of these options are available, cannonable spots with ranged or melee are preferable. Use Slayer reward points or Turael to skip undesirable tasks as often as possible. 

Slayer provides lots of passive experience in combat skills. Because of the bonuses given by the Slayer helmet (i), it offers some of the best rates of melee combat experience in the game. It also has the potential to be highly profitable.

General information
Access to Slayer masters
In general, obtain tasks from the highest-level Slayer master that your Combat and Slayer levels allow. The monsters they assign generally give more experience than lower-level Slayer masters. Duradel is the best Slayer master to use for the fastest experience, but some players may find that Nieve's (or Steve's) task weighting better suit their preferences. Note that just because the player can access better Slayer masters, this does not directly translate to more experience per hour. That is, maximising experience per hour is not simply a matter of always taking tasks from the highest-level Slayer master that is currently available to the player.

Some players train Slayer using only one master. However, players typically train Slayer by switching between two masters. They do this by using one specific Slayer master that is appropriate for (or lower than) their level, and then switch to using a different higher-levelled Slayer master in order to take advantage of completion milestones. There are Slayer completion milestones for every 10th, 50th, 100th, 250th and 1000th task completion that award additional Slayer points. Higher-levelled masters will assign more difficult tasks than the typical Slayer master would, either in monster assigned or quantity given, but the reward is a greater bonus of Slayer points.

Each Slayer master usually assigns various monsters based on a weight rating, which determines how likely the player is to get that task. Some Slayer masters have unique tasks to themselves, such as Konar quo Maten, who is the only one who assigns hydras. The latter three Slayer masters usually have a shared pool of assignable monsters, albeit with modifications to either the quantity or weighting.

Combat levels
By default, Slayer masters will assign tasks based on the player's combat level, essentially blocking tasks that are significantly higher until the player reaches the recommended level. The player can speak with Slayer masters regarding their combat level by choosing the option "Let's talk about the difficulty of my assignments.", and they will let players know if combat level checking is enabled or disabled. By default, players will receive the message,If combat level checking is disabled, players will receive the message, This option can be changed at any time by speaking to them again.

Slayer masters can sometimes assign players a task that may be difficult in combat level to complete. Such examples include blue dragons from Vannaka, which can be a challenging task for low-level players. While baby blue dragons are an option, there are a few requirements to access them. By making sure that combat level checking is enabled, a player will find themselves in fewer difficult combat situations.
Recommended stats
It is strongly recommended to have fairly high combat stats and to have completed a lot of quests for block slots before starting Slayer training. High combat stats increase damage output considerably and allow the player to use the best equipment available. Low-level Slayer masters also have poor task lists and give fewer Slayer reward points than the higher-level ones. 

A mid-level account with a combat level of 70 can start at Slayer master Chaeldar or with Konar quo Maten at level 75, and work their way towards higher-level Slayer masters such as Nieve and Duradel. An account with a combat level of 3 can start at Turael, but it is much more efficient to start at a higher level Slayer master after gaining combat levels and better equipment.

Recommended quests
Completing the following quests can improve the overall Slayer experience:

 Animal Magnetism gives an Ava's device, which reduces ammunition used while using Ranged weapons, and can be upgraded at higher ranged levels.

Desert Treasure I grants access to Ancient Magicks, allowing the use of Ice Burst/Ice Barrage for Slayer tasks
Fairytale I - Growing Pains grants access to fairy rings, granting easy access to many Slayer locations
Dwarf Cannon gives the ability to use a dwarf multicannon, speeding up tasks at the cost of cannonballs
Knight Waves Training Grounds unlocks the Piety prayer, boosting your melee stats 

Bear Your Soul unlocks the Soul bearer, which can transport ensouled heads to your bank

Equipment
Use the best equipment available for the fastest rates. If the player cannot afford best-in-slot equipment, it is best to prioritise melee strength and magic damage upgrades, with neck slot and ring slot items typically offering the most efficient upgrades by cost, followed by other armour upgrades.

The black mask is a very useful item for training Slayer, as it provides significant boosts to melee accuracy and strength when killing monsters on the player's current Slayer task. When imbued through the Nightmare Zone, it provides additional bonuses to ranged accuracy and strength as well as magic accuracy and damage. Both versions of the black mask can be turned into a Slayer helmet after the ability to do so is unlocked from a Slayer master for 400 reward points. It is highly recommended that this upgrade be prioritised as soon as possible, as doing so will allow the player to enjoy the bonuses while killing Slayer monsters requiring special headgear, such as aberrant spectres, banshees, wall beasts, dust devils and smoke devils.

The bracelet of slaughter and expeditious bracelet are popular choices for extending good tasks and quickening bad tasks respectively. Bracelets of slaughter are commonly used for extending barrage tasks like smoke devils which provide valuable experience, while expeditious bracelets are often used for tasks which players might otherwise skip, such as waterfiends. Due to their limited charges, it is often helpful to bring more than one per task. As they provide no combat bonuses, they are commonly equipped only as monsters die (if practical), with gloves with better bonuses being used for the rest of the kill, to maximize damage.

Slayer rings can be used to access the Stronghold Slayer Cave, Slayer Tower and the Fremennik Slayer Dungeon. The first teleport also leads directly to Nieve, making her easily accessible to players using her as their current Slayer master. The ability to craft Slayer rings may be unlocked for 150 reward points. After completing the Haunted Mine and Mourning's End Part II quests, the ring will also have teleports to Tarn's Lair and the Mourner Tunnels, providing quick access to terror dogs and dark beasts respectively.

If the player acquires an eternal gem, they may instead use that to create the eternal slayer ring, sharing all of the benefits of a normal slayer ring but with unlimited teleports.

|-|
Melee=

For Melee tasks, use equipment that offers the highest strength and accuracy bonuses, such as Amulet of rancour, the Ultor ring, and Ferocious gloves in combination with Torva armour and primordial boots. Sunfire fanatic armour can be used instead to give a higher Prayer bonus, reducing the amount of Prayer points drained per second.

The abyssal whip is a strong and easily obtainable weapon that can be used for melee tasks, with the more expensive Ghrazi rapier being an even better alternative for melee combat. Avernic or dragon defenders should always be used with these weapons, except against wyverns. For dragon tasks, players should use extended super antifire potions so they can hold their defender. 

The charged scythe of Vitur offers the best damage output against monsters that are 3x3 or larger, such as dark beasts, kalphite, and gargoyles. This weapon can be quite expensive to use, however. The dragon hunter lance is the best weapon to use against draconic enemies, and emberlight should be used against demons. If the player cannot afford a dragon hunter lance or Ghrazi rapier for dragons, a stab weapon such as Zamorakian hasta or Osmumten's fang should be used.

The Soulreaper axe is the strongest melee weapon available for most 1x1 and 2x2 slayer targets. When slaying conventional (e.g., non-dragon, non-demon) 1x1 targets such as ankou, earth warriors, small dagannoth, trolls, etc., the axe is a drastically more expensive option than the second-best melee weapon for such targets, the ghrazi rapier, but it offers 12-15% more damage per second. The axe also outperforms the Scythe of Vitur on common 2x2 slayer targets by 3-5%, such as suqah, mutated bloodveld, and large dagannoths. The axe is outperformed by emberlight against most demons, such as greater demons, lesser demons, abyssal demons, demonic gorillas, and tormented demons. The axe is outperformed by the dragon hunter lance against dragons, as most are weaker to stab than slash, and boast high defensive stats, unlike most other slayer monsters. Unlike the scythe, the axe does not expend charges to use. 

Dragon claws are generally the best special attack weapon to use for single combat. Dinh's bulwark is better for certain multi-combat areas (such as dagannoth), and is useful to draw aggression, however this can also be achieved with the use of a goading potion, freeing up special attack energy to be used for a weapon like the crystal halberd which can hit multiple targets. The dragon dagger is much cheaper than the dragon claws however, and the special attack can outperform dragon claws against monsters that have low Defence. Alternatively, players can use Saradomin godsword to restore Hitpoints and Prayer points during a task.

Recommended equipment

|-|
Magic (Barrage)=

Magic is commonly used to barrage or burst multiple monsters at once for fast Slayer experience. The Slayer helmet must be imbued to gain the accuracy and damage benefits on an assigned Slayer monster.

Use equipment that gives the highest Magic damage bonuses, such as kodai wand, occult necklace, imbued god cape, and virtus robes.

Use a weapon that can autocast Ancient Magicks. The cheapest of these is the ancient staff. The ancient sceptre, nightmare staff, and Kodai wand are progressively stronger alternatives.

Most Slayer monsters which are commonly barraged (such as greater Nechryael and dust devils) have very low Magic defence, so having a higher Magic accuracy makes negligible difference on damage output. For those tasks players may wear equipment with high Prayer bonus, such as ring of the gods (i), devout boots and book of darkness. Certain monsters (such as smoke devils and warped jellies) do have Magic defence however, so Magic accuracy will matter against them and players should wear equipment with high Magic accuracy bonuses.

Dinh's bulwark special attack, fast attacking ranged weapon such as a toxic blowpipe, dwarf multicannon, or a goading potion can be used to draw aggression of monsters into a barrage pile. If additional Melee experience is desired, using a Crystal halberd on stacked monsters is a solid option.

Recommended equipment

|-|
Ranged=

The venator bow is commonly used by players who desire a less intense form of Slayer training. The bow's ricochet effect easily grabs the aggression of multiple monsters, allowing it to be used on tasks that are commonly bursted/barraged at the cost of less Slayer experience per hour. On the other hand, the toxic blowpipe is the best option for players using Turael to boost Slayer points and for those do not value gaining Melee experience, as the blowpipe is usually faster than using Melee on most Turael tasks but at a higher cost.

If players do not have either of these weapons, then it is not recommended to use Ranged in general Slayer training, as Ranged can be comfortably trained without a slayer task, and minor amount of experience can be gained through use of a dwarf multicannon regardless. However, some tasks may be preferable to be safespotted using Ranged if the target is vulnerable to it and the player wishes to conserve supplies.

If using Ranged, the slayer helmet must be imbued to gain the accuracy and damage benefits on an assigned Slayer monster.

Recommended equipment

|-|
Ranged (Wilderness Slayer)=

Ranged is primarily used for Wilderness Slayer to boost Slayer points. The Webweaver bow and Craw's bow are the best weapons to use for most tasks, but for some tasks the toxic blowpipe is better due to its higher attack speed, and may be additionally preferred for the lesser risk. Players should bring 4 strong items, while the rest of the equipment should be cheap and replaceable items that the player will not mind losing. Notably, ether in the Webweaver and Craw's bow are always lost on death so players should not bring more than they are willing to lose.

If using Ranged, the slayer helmet must be imbued to gain the accuracy and damage benefits on an assigned Slayer monster.

Recommended equipment

Using Slayer reward points
Slayer reward points are awarded for the 5th consecutive task and every task thereafter. These can be used to cancel undesirable tasks, permanently block assignments and unlock useful rewards.

When training Slayer for the fastest experience, this is generally an optimal order for spending Slayer reward points:

Blocks (including the special Fossil Island Wyvern block)
Superior Slayer monsters
Slayer helmet
Extensions
Extra unlocks (such as Slayer rings)

Cancelling and blocking tasks
Slayer reward points are mainly used to cancel undesirable tasks, which offer slow experience, poor profit or mediocre experience but take too long to complete. Cancelling a task costs 30 reward points each time, making it potentially expensive to try and get a specific assignment.

Tasks that the player does not wish to ever do can be permanently blocked. The cost to block a task differs depending on the Slayer master:
 Turael/Aya and Spria: 40 points
 Mazchna/Achtryn: 50 points
 Vannaka: 60 points
 Chaeldar: 70 points
 Konar quo Maten: 80 points
 Nieve/Steve: 90 points
 Duradel/Kuradal: 100 points
 Krystilia: 100 points

Each Slayer master has their own individual block list. Up to seven assigned monsters (or monster groups) can be blocked per Slayer master. To block an assignment, 50 quest points are required per slot, totaling up to 300 quest points for six slots. A seventh slot is available only with the completion of the elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary. For toggled tasks like lizardmen, the player should simply cancel the toggle and the task itself, so that they cannot obtain the task anymore, which essentially acts as a block. With 500 Slayer points, a block can be applied to Fossil Island Wyverns. While significantly more expensive than any task block in-game, the player has the ability to freely toggle on and off this block as they desire.

The main goal for Slayer training is to spend as much time as possible doing good tasks, and as little time as possible doing bad tasks. As such, it is best to make use of all the available blocks as soon as possible, and then use the cancel option as often as it can be used while maintaining a stable level of Slayer reward points. Players are also strongly advised to keep enough points in reserve to cancel several tasks in a row, in case of multiple undesirable assignments being given.

The undesirable tasks with the highest weighting (highest chance of being given) should be blocked, as these will appear more often resulting in players burning through skips much faster compared to a task with a lower weighting. If the task is one given via toggle, the player can "block" the task in the future by simply toggling off, though points will need to be used again if the player wants to be assigned them. Otherwise, block tasks as needed; for example, between the choice of spiritual creatures (7) or rune dragons (2) from Duradel, blocking the former would be more beneficial than the latter. 

While the guide assumes that the player is training with Duradel, Nieve has a similar task list to him, albeit with the addition of some less desirable tasks such as brine rats and scabarites along with less weighting on other tasks. Simply adjust the task list to whatever slayer master is being used. Nieve, Konar and Duradel should be put into one group for non-Wilderness slayer, while Krystilia should be put in another due to being Wilderness-only slayer. 

An example of a block list for non-Wilderness slayer with these three masters in consideration could be:

Wyrms (bad task in general when accounting for efficient slayer)
Drakes (same as above)
Trolls 
Suqah (good for experience, very poor drop table)
Any remaining tasks up to preference

For Krystilia, a block list would likely have the following:

Bloodveld
Spiritual creatures
Green dragons
Any remaining tasks up to preference

When slaying for the fastest experience, spend the majority of the time doing high experience tasks, and spend the rest of the time doing relatively fast tasks for points. Even though a certain task offers decent experience in itself but takes fairly long to complete, such as black demons, it is likely not worth doing as this would mean spending less time doing tasks that offer much better experience per hour, thereby decreasing overall experience rates. The use of an Expeditious bracelet will help speed up undesirable tasks that need to be done.

If slaying solely for money-making purposes, the block list should be adjusted to ensure that the desired task(s) have a better chance of being assigned. For example, if a player was looking for araxytes from Duradel (having a weight of 10), their chances of getting it would improve if they blocked abyssal demons and dark beasts (who have a weight of 12 and 11 respectively). This list would be subjected to personal preference and thus does not account for slayer experience.

It is also required to have good gear before attempting a variant of the assigned monster, since these are generally stronger than their base variant in question.

Examples of alternate slayer would include:

Cerberus (hellhounds)
Demonic gorillas, Skotizo (black demons)
Kree'arra (aviansies)
Abyssal Sire (abyssal demon)
Thermonuclear smoke devil (smoke devil)
Araxxor (araxyte)
Tormented demon, K'ril Tsutsaroth, Skotizo (greater demons)
King Black Dragon (black dragons)
Vorkath (blue dragons)
Kraken (cave kraken)
Kalphite Queen (kalphites)
Dagannoth Kings (dagannoth)
Alchemical Hydra (hydras)

Note that alternate slayer with Konar is more complicated, due to her location-only requirement. Many options become inaccessible, while the ones she does offer will also require that specific location to allow it. For example, if the player wanted to kill the Abyssal Sire on her tasks, she would have to assign them to slay them in the Abyss in order to do so; any other location would not allow it.

Unlocking new tasks
With unlocking, you do not need a quest to access them. Instead, you pay with Slayer points to get these monsters for your Slayer assignment. Be aware that these task unlocks generally apply to high level Slayer Masters.

If you decide to stop doing assignments which are toggleable, consider if you will do the task again, or if alternatives are allowed, as these tasks generally have a high weight value and can potentially intercept a desirable task. TzHaar and lizardmen should generally not be blocked, as the former can be easily "cancelled" by entering and leaving the Fight Caves, while the latter is a very fast cannon task. Others, like red dragons and basilisks, should not be toggled on at all if not planning to kill them, since they are quite far from a bank and take a while to clear.

Earmuffs or Slayer helmet recommended.

Task extension
Some tasks can be extended for Slayer points, which will greatly increase the number that you can be assigned if they give you that creature for a task. Extending a task will significantly increase the amount of monsters assigned across all slayer masters, even if they normally assign less than another master would.

Only extend tasks that have good value to them, especially if they offer good money or experience. For example, Duradel normally assigns 60-80 araxytes. However, unlocking the extension will cause him to instead increase the amount to 200-250 araxytes. Araxytes are an already lucrative task, as they have a superior, a boss variant, can be mostly AFK'ed and offer good experience. On the other hand, extending a task such as metal dragons are discouraged, since they don't have a lot of good drops or offer reasonable experience to justify extending them.

Task storage
With the Task Storage perk unlocked (requiring 500 Slayer points), players may store their current Slayer task, saving it for later. They may swap their current task and stored task when desired for no charge. Purchasing Task Storage is up to the player's preference; while the perk has a high upfront cost, it allows the player to break up long and monotonous Slayer tasks with potentially shorter ones.

Superior Slayer monsters
right|173x173px
With the Bigger and Badder perk unlocked (requiring 50 Slayer points), several monsters have a 1/200 chance of attracting a superior variant of the monster after they are killed. Superior monsters are stronger than their normal counterparts, typically having a higher max hit and some of them may have a simple mechanic. They can also drop the valuable and sought-after eternal gem and imbued heart, both of which sell considerably well on the Grand Exchange, along with a 10x increased drop rate on clue scrolls should the monster be capable of dropping clue scrolls.

Activating this perk is optional, but recommended since you can toggle it off without penalty if you do not want to fight superior monsters.

Killing perks 
The only recommended killing perk to obtain is Gargoyle Smasher should the player do gargoyle tasks. High levelled Slayer masters will assign gargoyles quite frequently, and players will save a large amount of time by automatically smashing Gargoyles whenever they reach 9 hitpoints or lower, and automatically smashes Dawn and Dusk when they reach 8 hitpoints. Shroom Sprayer can also be unlocked, but only if the player completes mutated zygomite tasks.

Dwarf multicannon
thumb|Green represents double shots. Red means no fire. For 1x1 monsters, players should lure them onto the green area.
The dwarf multicannon adds a significant amount of extra damage output, and it should be used whenever viable. Using the cannon can be quite expensive, but the cost is justified by the saved time compared to not using one. For example, certain Melee tasks like suqahs, dagannoth and kalphites offer good experience per hour with the cannon as the cannon does a lot of damage in these multi-combat areas, but without the cannon the experience rates would be mediocre at best. The player will also gain some passive Ranged experience while getting nearly as much Melee experience per hour as the player would without using a cannon.

The dwarf multicannon is typically used to speed up Melee tasks, and to lure smoke devils. For Melee tasks, it is best to find the best spot to stand to allow double cannon shots against one monster. This allows faster kills, slightly increasing experience rates. Around 750–1,500 cannonballs are used on an average task given by Duradel in a non-multiway combat area, whilst tasks which take place in a multiway combat area can exceed over 1,500.

Should the player not be able to afford to use the cannon at all, it is better to simply make the money for the cannonballs rather than train Slayer without the cannon. Players should also consider how much time they will spend on tasks where the cannon is used, as having a cannon-heavy task list is much more expensive and generally less efficient than doing a lot of barrage tasks. For example, it may be a good idea not to extend tasks where little to no money is made back from the drops, such as black demons or suqahs. On some cannonable tasks monster drops will cover some of the cost of using the cannon, but usually not enough to break even. Most barrage tasks on the other hand usually break even or even profit slightly.

Prayer
Use protection and offensive prayers when training Slayer. Players will need to bring prayer potions or super restores to every task, and have a good supply of them in the bank. It is also recommended to have a high Prayer level, as it allows you to pay less attention to your Prayer points, and having a higher Prayer level allows you to restore more prayer points per prayer potion dose. The holy wrench also boosts the amount of prayer gained from prayer potions, thus reducing the number of prayer potions used. These make the overall lifespan of your potions much higher, and save a lot of money in the long run.

Having the rejuvenation pool (or better) in the player-owned house or a quick access to any altar to restore Prayer points before starting a new task is useful. However, players should not constantly teleport out from the task area to restore Prayer points and run back there, as this lowers experience rates significantly and it is worth the money to simply drink prayer potions whenever needed. Furthermore, if a player leaves an area where they were fighting a popular slayer creature, it may open up the location for another player to "take their spot".

The best available offensive prayers should always be used for Melee and Ranged, and also for Magic if having a higher Magic accuracy makes a notable difference on damage output (such as against smoke devils and Warped Jellies). It is recommended not to use offensive Magic prayers against monsters with low Magic defence, as this would have a negligible benefit to damage output unless the prayer offers one or more max hits. However, for Melee and Ranged offensive prayers increases the max hit and thus the damage output considerably, and using them is worth the cost.

Use protection prayers on dangerous tasks where the monsters would deal heavy damage. Such tasks include all barrage tasks and most tasks in multi-combat areas, metal dragons, dark beasts, aberrant spectres and other damage-heavy tasks. Protection prayers along with Prayer-boosting armour (such as Proselyte armour) can also be used as a low-effort alternative to defensive armour and food. This requires paying less attention overall as the player will not take damage and the Prayer points are drained at a slower rate.

Prayer flicking is a tedious and a click-intensive but an extremely efficient way of saving Prayer points. If you are willing to put the effort, it can more than triple the life span of your prayer points with proper timing.

 Slayer locations
While some Slayer monsters are found in one or multiple habitats, there are dungeons throughout RuneScape where many monsters a Slayer master can assign can be found.
LocationAdvantages Disadvantages  Slayer Tower Has various Slayer monsters, some of them being less crowded due to other locations. You also receive more experience if you have the Morytania diaries done. Monsters on the upper floors are annoying to reach without high Agility and a cannon can't be used in the tower. Fremennik Slayer DungeonHas various Slayer monsters, with most of them being found only in the dungeon.Can be somewhat annoying to reach the end of the dungeon without high Agility, some areas can be crowded.Stronghold Slayer CaveHas a handful of monsters that medium/high levelled Slayer masters assign, and close to a bank. A cannon can be used in this cave.Often crowded. Catacombs of KourendSimilar to the Stronghold Slayer Cave, but with stronger monsters and in some cases, better drops than those found elsewhere. It is also a multi-combat area so you can semi-afk more efficiently here. Some tasks are very efficient here, like dust devils and nechryael. Somewhat far without teleports to the dungeon, and a cannon can't be placed in the dungeon.Chasm of FireContains lesser, greater and black Demons. The black demons here can be more easily cannoned than those in Taverley Dungeon.Can be far if optimal teleports are not unlocked.Kalphite CaveMore kalphites can be found in here.Wilderness Slayer CaveAll locations are multicombat and cannonable. Monsters also drop unique wilderness tertiary drops which can significantly increase average value of each kill.Is in the Wilderness so high risk of PKers interrupting tasks.Iorwerth DungeonUpon their deaths, monsters in the dungeon have a chance of dropping 3-5 crystal shards, while superior slayer monsters are guaranteed to drop 6-10.Must have completed Song of the Elves to access Prifddinas.
The following transportation methods help players get to their tasks faster.

 Fairy ring teleport system - grants quick access to many high-level Slayer tasks. You can use the fairy rings after starting Fairytale II - Cure a Queen with a Lunar/Dramen staff. Not needed if you have completed all the Lumbridge & Draynor Village sets.
Lunar Magic - used for NPC Contact, allowing you to talk to any Slayer master without travelling to them. However, the rewards interface cannot be accessed this way, so travel to any Slayer master may be necessary to cancel. Also used for Spellbook Swap to access non-tablet teleports like Trollheim Teleport and Ghorrock Teleport in the Ancient Magicks book. You must complete Lunar Diplomacy to use Lunar Magic. You must complete Desert Treasure I for Ancient Magicks.
 Slayer ring - can be used to teleport to several Slayer locations (obtained from a Slayer master for Slayer points). Slayer rings should be made in batches and treated as disposable to allow more loot to be banked. Players who wish to skip or block a task should use the Slayer ring to teleport to the Stronghold Slayer Cave, which is right next to Nieve.
Karamja gloves 3 - Reward for Hard Karamja Diary. (It allows you to teleport to Shilo Village for quickly getting a new task from Duradel). Karamja gloves 4 allows the player to transport directly to Duradel.
Xeric's talisman - can be used to teleport around Great Kourend to enter the Catacombs of Kourend or to fight Lizardmen.

Player-owned houses
Player-owned houses are a great asset for Slayer training, though it does take considerable input to get the required Construction levels.

Useful unlocks
At , portal chambers can be built. The portals can then be constructed and set to teleport to various destinations around RuneScape, covering many of the teleports that the spellbooks have. You need to have the respective Magic level and other requirements completed to attune a portal to a specific location.

At , a portal nexus can be built. The nexus combines the various portals into a single object and room.

At , an Ancient, Lunar, or Dark altar can be built. These can be used to swap to Ancient Magicks, the Lunar spellbook, or the Arceuus spellbook, respectively, or to swap from any spellbook back to the Standard spellbook. At , these can be upgraded to the Occult altar, providing access to the other two spellbooks.

At , the ornate rejuvenation pool can be built, regenerating the player's special attack energy, run energy, prayer points, reduced stats, and health when interacted with. This saves a lot of supplies if you use the house a lot.

At , the ornate jewellery box can be built, providing unlimited uses of the ring of dueling, games necklace, skills necklace, combat bracelet, amulet of glory, and ring of wealth teleports.

At  and , the spirit tree & fairy ring can be built. This provides the perks of both the spirit tree and fairy ring at once, which when combined with the ornate rejuvenation pool will save lots of supplies and essentially allows you to reach anywhere in RuneScape without having to use other items. It is worth noting two superior gardens can be built for a spirit tree in one and one fairy ring in the other garden before level 95 Construction with a crystal saw and stew Construction boosts.

Location
Scrolls of redirection can be used to teleport to player-owned house portals other than the house's current location.

Alternate training methods
Aside from quest rewards and traditional slayer training, the Temple Trekking minigame can provide Slayer XP at a low hourly rate via the XP rewards, alongside Agility, Firemaking, Fishing, Mining, Thieving, and Woodcutting. This may be useful for some accounts in niche scenarios - resource-lacking / Ironmen / combat focused accounts moving to skilling, or quest requirements. 

The money-making guide for Temple Trekking contains a profitable route and good process, though it can be adjusted to take easier companions instead of the recommended Hard ones if focusing purely on the XP tome rewards. XP tomes grant between 1100 and 1650 in one of the skills listed above (randomly selected, you do not get to choose which skill), and can be claimed once per trek as a reward.  

Around 40 treks an hour are possible fully focusing (and if skipping all combat), and with the average XP tome granting 1375 XP, 55,000 XP across all skills can be expected, an average of around 7800 XP per skill. A more leisurely 30 treks / hour results in around 41,250 - around 5800XP / skill.

Recommended training methods
Levels 1–9: Natural History Quiz
Completing the Natural History Quiz in Varrock Museum grants the player 1,000 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 9. To start the quiz, speak to Orlando Smith, located in the basement of the museum.

Levels 9–44/80/99: Bird house trapping

Bird house trapping is a recurring Hunter training method, much like Farming. To do a bird house run, set up bird house traps on Fossil Island and fill them with suitable seeds. After 50 minutes, dismantle the traps for Hunter experience and loot, and set them up again for the next run. There are four spots in which the player can place bird house traps, indicated by the File:Bird house site icon.png icon.

For this method, players must have completed Bone Voyage to access Fossil Island. It is strongly recommended to have a lot of digsite pendants for the fastest transportation to the island. Digsite pendants can be made by enchanting ruby necklaces using the Lvl-3 Enchant spell or the respective magic tablet. Being able to enchant ruby necklaces requires finding a clean necklace and showing it to one of the archaeologists in the Varrock Museum.

Building a bird house requires a clockwork, a log of the corresponding kind, a hammer, and a chisel. Having the Crafting level to build the bird houses is recommended, as the assembled traps are uncommonly traded in the Grand Exchange. When collecting a filled bird house, the clockwork will be returned, along with bird nests and feathers. Use cheap low-level seeds to fill the bird houses, such as potato or onion seeds.

This method offers the fastest Hunter experience effectively up to level 80. It is viable even up to level 99, as long as obtaining levels quickly is not required. However, players may want to switch to drift net fishing at level 44 Hunter, as it is more efficient overall if the player also needs to train Fishing. For Hunter alone, this method is a lot better than the active training methods at lower levels. Players who seek for the fastest Hunter experience in real time likely find it best to do bird house runs for the majority of the experience at lower levels.

The table below lists the experience for a single (full) birdhouse. Multiply this by 4 to get the total experience for a full run. One run takes around 73–90 seconds, which equates to 40–49 runs per actively spent hour.

Initial bird house run
Items required for the initial bird house run and unlocking three Mushtrees, which assist with transport around the island later:
A digsite pendant with at least 3 charges
Hammer
Chisel
4 logs
4 clockworks
40 seeds of any kind, eg potato or onion (20 if using wildblood seeds or herb seeds Ranarr and above)
1 stamina potion

Teleport to the Digsite using the Digsite pendant. Use the Quick-Travel option on the barge guard to travel to Fossil Island.
Run west to the swamp entrance. While running, use the clockworks on the logs to craft 4 bird houses.
Place a bird house at the space near the swamp entrance (at the more north-western entrance, by the birdhouse symbol.)
Use the seeds on the bird house (Needs to be done manually for all bird houses)
Run north-east to the hill, and follow the path to the House on the Hill. Climb the stairs until you reach an area with a Mushtree and some machines.
Use the Digsite pendant on the southern machine (Strange Machine)  to unlock the teleport option on the Digsite pendant to Fossil Island.
Click on the Mushtree north to unlock the Mushtree teleport option to the House on the Hill.
Teleport to the Digsite and travel back to Fossil Island (or just walk back). From here, run north-west to the File:Bird house site icon.png icon at the north-west of the Mushroom forest.
Click on the Mushtree nearby to unlock the Mushtree teleport option to Mushroom Meadow.
Place a bird house to the spot north of the Mushtree.
Teleport to the Digsite and travel back to Fossil Island. From here, follow the coastline south until you see an opening in the north-east. Head a bit north-east and run inside the valley with two File:Bird house site icon.png icons.
Place the final two bird houses on the spots in the valley, and click on the Mushtree to unlock the Mushtree teleport option to Verdant Valley.

Doing a bird house run
After the initial run, the items required for a bird house run are as follows:
A Digsite pendant with at least 1 charge
Hammer
Chisel
4 logs or 4 bird houses
40 seeds of any kind (20 if using wildblood seeds or herb seeds Ranarr and above)
1 clockwork (optional but recommended)

Bringing the extra clockwork allows the player to craft the bird houses while running to the next one. This will save a few seconds compared to crafting bird houses after harvesting them. Alternatively, craft the bird houses while storing them in the bank. While collecting your birdhouses you only need a replacement birdhouse and seeds. With this method, you will not need to use the hammer or chisel. This method shaves off a few seconds as there is no animation for crafting houses. While slower, birdhouses can be reset in a single click using the "Reset" right-click option on them, which will dismantle, craft, and place a new birdhouse, although seeds will still need to be added afterwards.

Doing a bird house run goes as follows:
Teleport to Fossil Island using the Fossil Island option on the digsite pendant, and use the Mushtree to go to Verdant Valley. While running, use a log on the clockwork to craft a bird house.
Check and place the western bird house, followed by the eastern one.
Use the Mushtree to Mushroom Meadow, and check and place the bird house north of the Mushtree.
Run south to the Sticky Swamp entrance, and check and place the final bird house.

 Levels 44–99: Drift net fishing 

Drift net fishing is the most efficient way to train both Hunter and Fishing at the same time. However, it is not the fastest way to train Hunter on its own due to the split rates. Once Fishing no longer needs to be trained, switch to a method that offers faster Hunter experience.

Drift net fishing requires level 44 Hunter and level 47 Fishing (both unboostable), and completion of Bone Voyage to access Fossil Island underwater. For optimal rates, players will also need to wear a fishbowl helmet and a diving apparatus obtained from the Pirate Pete subquest of Recipe for Disaster, as well as flippers obtained from mogres. Wearing a merfolk trident, a trident of the seas, a trident of the swamp, or a dragon harpoon will increase the chance of successfully chasing the fish shoal into the nets. In addition, stamina potions (or some other form of run energy restoration) are needed for the fastest rates.

To do this method, speak to Ceto to enter the fishing area located in the northern part of the Fossil Island underwater. This costs 200 numulites per day, or 20,000 numulites for permanent access. Set up drift nets on the drift net anchors and click the fish shoals once to chase them into the nets. Prioritise fish shoals nearer to the drift nets. The nets will become full after 10 fish shoals caught, after which the player will need to set the drift nets up again. Players can store up to 2,000 drift nets at Annette by bringing her the nets in banknotes.

Players can optionally bank the fish caught for 5 numulites per full net. This will lower experience rates slightly, but will also offset the money spent on drift nets. The quality of fish obtained scales with the Fishing level, with raw lobsters starting to be caught at level 50. 

The experience rates in the table below assume 1,150 fish shoal caught per hour. Expect slightly lower rates if banking the fish. The experience per fish shoal scales until level 70 Hunter and Fishing.  With good practice, it is possible to catch up to 1,200–1,250 fish shoal per hour. Buying the drift nets on the Grand Exchange would cost  per hour.

From level 44 to 99 Hunter, the player will gain 9,842,153 Fishing experience if starting at level 47 Fishing. This would require 12,944 drift nets, which would cost .

Fastest active training methods
Use Hunter potions to boost the Hunter level to be able to catch creatures earlier than they become available. In addition, boosting the Hunter level before level 20, 40, 60, and 80 allows the player to set an extra trap for faster experience rates.

Bring the following items:

A noose wand, stamina potions, and ring of pursuits to track kebbits at levels 9–25 and 49-73.
A butterfly net to catch butterflies at levels 25–37.
Small fishing nets and ropes for net trapping at levels 37–43.
 for Falconry fee at levels 43–49
Box traps to catch chinchompas starting at level 73.

Levels 9–13: Feldip weasels
thumb|200px|Location of the feldip weasels.
From level 9 to 25, catch feldip weasels in the Feldip Hunter area. To quickly get there, use a Feldip Hills teleport scroll and run south near to the dungeon icon. Equip a noose wand and a ring of pursuit, and inspect one of the burrows to start tracking a kebbit. Follow the end of the trail, attack the bush to catch the kebbit, and inspect a burrow again. Equipping a ring of pursuit will reveal the entire track at once.

Players can gain around 13,000 experience per hour. More information about catching feldip weasels can be found here.

Although the desert devils provide faster rates from level 13 onwards, the time saved to reach level 25 by hunting them is only 10 minutes.

Levels 13–25: Desert devils

From level 13 to 25, catch desert devils in the Uzer hunter area. To quickly get there, rub Necklace of passage, teleport to Eagles' Eyrie, and run south near until you find two salamander traps with a burrow nearby. Bring 6–7 full waterskins for the desert heat.

Equip a noose wand and a ring of pursuit, and inspect one of the burrows to start tracking a kebbit. Attack the bush at the end of the tracks to catch the kebbit, and inspect a nearby burrow again.

Players can gain around 18,500 experience per hour.

Levels 25–37: Sapphire glacialis

From level 25 to 37, catch sapphire glacialis at Mons Gratia. Equip a butterfly net and head to south-west of the mountains peak. You can find two spawns close by and players can achieve around 25,000–33,000 experience per hour, although at level 25 you can only expect around 25,000 experience per hour.

To help you catch the butterflies you can use minimenu reordering to avoid clicking the other butterflies and mark the spawn tiles. Catching these butterflies from north or east side will cause the butterflies to flee south-west reducing the amount of running required and improving your overall experience rates.

From level 35 onwards unequip your butterfly net (if not using a magic butterfly net) for slightly better catch rates.

Levels 37–43: Swamp lizards
From level 37 to 43, catch swamp lizards north-west of Slepe. Trapping lizards requires a rope and small fishing net for each trap. Two traps can be set at levels 29–39, and three traps can be set beginning at level 40. Drop the swamp lizards as soon as possible to reduce run energy consumption. Wearing weight-reducing clothing may be useful for maintaining run energy.

Even though swamp lizards become available at level 29, sapphire glacialis offer slightly faster experience rates before three traps are available.

Players can gain around 20,000–28,000 experience per hour at levels 29–37. With three traps, the experience rates are increased to around 40,000–45,000 experience per hour. Upon reaching level 37, it is strongly recommended to bring four hunter potions to boost the Hunter level to be able to set three traps.

Levels 43–49: Falconry
alt=Ideal spotted kebbit training area with three spawn points in the south-eastern corner.|thumb|Ideal spotted kebbit training area with three spawn points in the south-eastern corner.
From level 43 to 49, catch spotted kebbits (and dark kebbits at level 57) using the falconry technique. To do this, enter the Piscatoris falconry area east of the fairy ring  and rent a gyr falcon for 500 coins. The weapon, shield, and hands slots must be empty for this. Head to the south-eastern area and click on the kebbits to send the falcon towards the kebbit. When the falcon catches the kebbit, retrieve the falcon and the loot, and drop the loot afterwards. To minimise downtime, stand close to the kebbit or the spawn tile before using the falcon.

Wear weight-reducing clothing to reduce run energy drain, and bring a stamina potion to restore run energy. The bonecrusher will automatically bury the bones from the kebbits, which reduces dropping.

The following rates can be expected while training here:
 Spotted kebbits (43-57) give 60,000 up to 70,000. You can reduce the amount of run energy used to catch spotted kebbits by focusing on their three spawn points located at the south-eastern corner of the falconry area. Spotted kebbits will respawn 4 seconds after being retrieved by the player.
 Dark kebbits (57-60+) give 75,000 up to 80,000. Spawn points for dark kebbits are spread throughout the edges of the falconry area. The two spawn points closest to each other are on the west edge of the area. Dark kebbits will respawn 4 seconds after being retrieved by the player.
 Dashing kebbits (69+) give 85,000 up to 95,000. Since dashing kebbits do not become available until level 69, training with them is not popular since salamaders offer better experience rates from level 60 onwards.

Levels 49–73: Razor-backed kebbits

From the level 49 to 73, catch razor-backed kebbits at the Piscatoris hunter area. Use the fairy ring  and head east. Just before the falconry there are bushes and burrows where the kebbits hide. Equip a noose wand and a ring of pursuit. Search a nearby burrow and attack the bush revealed by the tracks to catch the kebbit granting 348.5 experience.

Players can gain up to 130,000 experience per hour. Having an alternative account supply new rings of pursuit and stamina potions increases the rates to around 140,000 experience per hour. The rings of pursuit can be stored in the Huntsman's kit so large numbers of rings can be brought before requiring another account to re-supply. Without stamina potions, expect rates only up to 100,000 experience per hour.

Extra considerations:

 Wear weight-reducing clothing to reduce run energy drain
 Wear the bonecrusher necklace to automatically bury the bones granting Prayer experience
 Use a chisel to fletch long kebbit spikes into stackable long kebbit bolts granting fletching experience. This can be done between the furthest bushes and the burrow without losing ticks. It is not recommended to do this on the closest bushes.
 Use minimenu reordering to change the default left click option of the bushes to "attack"
 Use minimenu reordering to change the default left click option of raw beast meat to "drop"
 If you search a burrow without ring of pursuit equipped, hop worlds, equip a ring, and search a burrow again
 Generally using the East-most burrow every time allows for the least amount of downtime between captures

Levels 72/91–99: Hunters' Rumours

Players can choose to complete Hunters' Rumours assigned by Guild hunters in the Hunter Guild. Guild hunters will tell the player to investigate about a specific hunter creature, which the player needs to hunt until a rare creature part is dropped. Each Guild hunter has a specific (unboostable) Hunter level requirement, with Novice, Adept, Expert, and Master rumours being unlocked at level 46, 57, 72, and 91, respectively.

Even though Hunters' Rumours become available at level 46, it is recommended to start with expert rumours at level 72, as novice and adept rumours offer relatively low experience rates.

The player can freely switch between rumours from different Guild hunters. Because two different Guild hunters can never assign the same hunter creature, it is possible to block a specific task by having it assigned by a Guild hunter and then completing tasks from other Guild hunters. The player may also talk to Guild Scribe Verity to toggle "back-to-back" rumours at any time, which can increase experience rates.

Upon completing a rumour, the player will gain Hunter experience calculated with the formula , where:
  is the player's Hunter level after completing a rumour
 The value of  is dependent on the tier of rumour completed:
 50 when turning in a Novice or Adept rumour
 55 when turning in an Expert rumour
 60 when turning in a Master rumour

Players can expect up to 235,000 experience per hour depending on their current level, available teleports, and their hunter creature block list. At level 99, it is possible to gain up to 250,000 experience per hour.

Levels 73–99: Black chinchompas
Requires completion of the Eagles' Peak quest to be able to set box traps.
152px|right Hunting black chinchompas offers the fastest Hunter experience from level 73 onwards, and it is also profitable. They can only be found in the hunting area in level 32–36 Wilderness, however, this is a popular player killing hot spot.

Players who do not wish to use tick manipulation, hunt in the Wilderness, or use alternative account are advised to train with Hunters' Rumours, as this offers similar experience rates.

The fastest way to get there is to use a Wilderness Obelisk from the player-owned house or east of Corporeal Beast's Lair to level 35 Wilderness, then running a bit south-east (completion of hard tasks in the Wilderness Diary is strongly recommended). Alternatively, players can use a revenant cave teleport and run south. Another option is to use a waka canoe from Edgeville to the Wilderness pond (requires 57 Woodcutting). Players with 99 Hunter can also use the Hunter cape teleport to black chinchompas.

For the fastest rates, use a ranged weapon to shoot the stray chinchompas that wander far away from the box traps. Shooting a stray chinchompa forces a new one to spawn, and the newly spawned chinchompa usually goes much faster into the trap than a stray one.

Box traps can be placed one tick faster via tick manipulation. When correctly timed, it is also possible to lay a trap instantly after picking up another (also known as trap resetting). This is done by moving to the desired spot on the same tick as laying the previous trap, picking up the next, and clicking it up as soon as possible in the inventory. This will increase experience rates, but requires more accurate clicks. For tick manipulation, use a knife and teak/mahogany logs instead of herb and tar, as it only requires 2 inventory spaces instead of 3.

The overall process using tick manipulation and trap resetting looks like:

 Check a filled box trap
 Delay the skilling timer (e.g., use a knife on a teak/mahogany log) on the same tick
 Click underneath your character to cancel the skilling action
 Lay the box trap from your inventory
 Walk to the next trap on the same tick
 Check it as your character arrives
 Lay the box trap from your inventory when it appears
 Walk to the next trap on the same tick
 Check, lay, and walk as above
 Continue from the beginning of this list (by checking a trap and delaying the skilling timer)

alt=Black chin 1 tick manipulation|thumb|Player resetting all traps using 1 tick manipulation|width=407x407Using a shooting alt is recommended for the fastest experience rates. Using a crystal bow on it is recommended, but a magic shortbow with cheap arrows will suffice if the account does not have the requirement for the crystal bow. The shooting alt can also be used to carry extra supplies, such as box traps (which allows for more inventory space for supplies for the main account), Saradomin brews, super restores and spare logs for tick manipulation (in case of mistakes).

Experience rates shown in the table below assume using tick manipulation, having good practice with the method, and being attacked by a player killer once every 1–2 hours. Expect lower rates if learning or getting attacked more often. At level 99, the maximum possible experience rate caps at around 300,000 experience per hour when uninterrupted, using a shooting alt, and using tick manipulation.

Combating against player killers
As black chinchompas reside in a hot spot in the Wilderness, the player may get attacked by player killers. It is recommended to have high Defence and Magic levels (90+) and wear good defensive gear to have higher chances of escaping. Having the Augury prayer (requires reading an arcane prayer scroll and 77 Prayer) is also strongly recommended as it increases the player's defences by 25% when activated. If the player can not use Augury, Mystic Vigour and Steel Skin should be used instead. Players will also need a teleport that works up to level 30 Wilderness, such as a royal seed pod or an amulet of glory.

It is generally best to use equipment that prioritises magic defence while having good defences against melee and ranged attacks. Setups can vary greatly depending on how much money the player has available and how much one is willing to risk in case of a death. When choosing protected items, the Masori body (f), a tank shield such as the elysian/spectral spirit shield or the dinh's bulwark, the ring of suffering (i), the serpentine helm, and the staff of the dead (if using an off-hand shield) are considered the best options. For low levels, it is recommended to bring something more replaceable that is still effective, such as black dragonhide armour.

The phoenix necklace restores the wearer's Hitpoints by 30% of maximum if they drop below 20% of the maximum. It is the best item to wear in the neck slot regardless of the setup, because it often saves the player from getting comboed by special attacks.

Players will also need to bring an anti-venom+ to cure venom or wear a serpentine helm in case a player killer is using a venom-inflicting weapon such as a toxic staff of the dead.

Flicking overhead prayers accordingly can reduce the damage taken from player killers' attacks. Set your quick prayers to Protect from Melee, Protect Item and Augury (or Mystic Vigour and Steel Skin if you do not have Augury unlocked). Protect from Melee makes you less vulnerable to rushers using Armadyl godsword, dragon claws or granite maul special attacks, however if you see the player killer using Tele Block, quickly switch to Protect from Magic to halve the duration of teleblock in case the player killer splashes. If you are frozen, switch between Protect from Missiles and Melee (sometimes Magic) depending on which combat style the player is attacking, and use Protect from Magic when you are unfrozen to reduce the damage from Ice Barrage.

An escaping tactic is to bring a Zamorak godsword to freeze a player killer in place and log out while standing under them. The player killer will not unfreeze in time to retaliate. When timed correctly, the player can consistently escape with this method because the PJ timer is longer (12 seconds) than the logout delay while in combat (10 seconds). If using this tactic, enable PK Skull Prevention to avoid getting skull-tricked.

|-|
Staff of the dead (high-risk) =
This setup aims for the highest tanking potential using the staff of the dead along with expensive equipment with high, but reasonable risk. It is very unlikely to die to a player killer in the best listed setup, as long as the player keeps their Hitpoints high. This allows the player to keep training Hunter without constantly having to bank the chinchompas.

The damage reduction effect of the elysian spirit shield makes it the best option for the shield slot. The spectral spirit shield is much more affordable and its +30 Magic defence bonus significantly helps at not getting frozen or teleblocked, but it is also much worse at tanking Melee and Ranged attacks.

The staff of the dead special attack halves the all Melee damage of your opponent(s) (all opponents that hit you in the time of the special attack) for one minute. A staff of light or staff of balance can also used instead as they have the exact same bonuses and special attack.

If not using a shooting alt, bring a magic shortbow or rune crossbow with cheap arrows/bolts to shoot the stray chinchompas.

Serpentine helm is the best option, as it provides immunity to venom when worn, saving an inventory space, has good Melee and Ranged defences and does not penalise Magic defence. However, it usually adds extra risk and should only be worn by players who are confident in their tanking abilities.

The Construction cape is the best option for the cape slot as it can be used to quickly get back in case the player has to teleport out. If the player does not have 99 Construction, any other trimmed skillcape should be used instead, followed by god capes. Wearing a fire cape is also an option if the player does not mind risking it on death, as it has slightly better defensive stats than a skillcape. If the player is not using an alternative account, Ranging cape should be used, followed by Ava's accumulator.

Players can optionally bring a Torag's platelegs switch for tanking Melee and Ranged attacks.

|-|
Dinh's bulwark (low-risk) =
This setup uses the Dinh's bulwark for Melee and Ranged defence and Ranged armour for Magic defence. This is a much more affordable option compared to the high-risk setup and possesses significantly less risk, but also makes the player more vulnerable to player killers. Escaping player killers should be relatively easy with good prayer flicking, however it might be a good idea to bank chinchompas every so often to reduce the risk.

Serpentine helm is the best option, as it provides immunity to venom when worn, saving an inventory space, has good Melee and Ranged defences and does not penalise Magic defence.

If not using a shooting alt, bring a magic shortbow with cheap arrows to shoot the stray chinchompas. Simply switch to the Dinh's bulwark if attacked by a player killer.

The Construction cape is the best option for the cape slot as it can be used to quickly get back in case the player has to teleport out. If the player does not have 99 Construction, any other trimmed skillcape should be used instead, followed by god capes.

Other methods
Levels 35–99: Aerial Fishing

Aerial Fishing on Molch Island provides split experience between Hunter and Fishing, and also gives some passive Cooking experience as well. The activity becomes available at level 43 Fishing and level 35 Hunter. Due to the split rates it is not the fastest route to train Hunter alone, but if player needs to train both Hunter and Fishing, Aerial Fishing is a viable training method. Experience rates scale quite a lot depending on levels, between 25,000-80,000 Hunter experience per hour. Aerial fishing is also the only method for obtaining the Pearl fishing rod, Pearl fly fishing rod, Pearl barbarian fishing rod,Fish sack, and the golden tench.

Levels 47–59: Orange salamanders
Catching orange salamanders is a slower but less click-intensive alternative to falconry. You will need three small fishing nets, three ropes as well as 10 to 14 waterskins (4) and Desert clothing to protect a player from the desert heat's effect. The full Desert clothing set allows 120 seconds between each sip from a waterskin. The more southern spot next to the lizards has 3 trees without obstacles and are closest to each other.

There are two spots you can hunt Orange salamanders which are Uzer hunter area and Necropolis hunter area, the latter requires Beneath Cursed Sands and can be reached by Fairy ring code  and 62 Agility.

To get to the Uzer hunter area, pass through the Shantay Pass, and head south-east until you've reached a bridge. Cross it, and the spot is a bit more east. Alternatively, use fairy ring code  and run north to the hunter spot. Another option is using the necklace of passage and teleporting to the Eagle's Eyrie, and running south from there.

If you have access to Lunar Spells, level 68 Magic, and completed the Dream Mentor quest, you can also bring runes to cast Humidify to refill all of your waterskins at once.

Players can gain around 40,000–50,000 experience per hour, depending on speed and Hunter level at the Uzer hunter area. Players can gain around 50,000–63,000 experience per hour at the Necropolis hunter area. This is increased to 90,000 to 100,000 experience per hour at level 60. At level 80, players can expect about 145,000 experience per hour at the Necropolis area. You will need to catch 772 orange salamanders for level 47–59.

Levels 60–99: Maniacal monkeys

Maniacal monkeys are a low-effort alternative to the faster training methods, requiring interaction once every 25–30 seconds. To catch them, mount a stunted demonic gorilla and set up a deadfall trap on one of the large boulders using a banana as bait. Wait until a monkey catches the bait and set up the trap again. A successful catch gives 1,000 Hunter experience and a damaged monkey tail. There is also a 1/5,000 chance to get a monkey tail which can be sold for profit.

Maniacal monkeys are located in Glough's Laboratory in Kruk's Dungeon, which requires completion of Monkey Madness II and a Kruk monkey greegree to access. To get there, take the gnome glider to Ape Atoll and investigate the jungle grass just south to enter the dungeon. Go north and cross the monkeybars with the Kruk monkey greegree equipped, and continue north through the passage.

Bring baskets of bananas to extend trips. An inventory of baskets lasts for around 50 minutes. While trips can be extended further by picking up bones and using Bones to Bananas tablets, it is recommended to simply bank for more bananas because picking up bones adds a lot of extra effort and the method is primarily considered as a low-effort alternative.

Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume bringing baskets of bananas and banking every 50 minutes, as well as include some idle time. At level 99, it is possible to gain up to 120,000 experience per hour.

  level XP/h6051,0006559,0007066,0007574,0008082,0008589,0009096,00095104,00099110,000

Levels 60–67: Red salamanders
From level 60 to 67, catch red salamanders south of the entrance to the Ourania Cave. Bring 5 ropes, 5 small fishing nets, and some stamina potions. Set up four net traps onto the young trees in the southern area, and drop the caught salamanders as soon as possible. With 5 ropes and nets, traps can be reset before picking up the collapsed ones. Wearing weight-reducing clothing and drinking stamina potions might be beneficial in lower agility levels. 

Even though red salamanders become available at level 59, catching kebbits in the Piscatoris falconry area offers slightly faster experience than catching red salamanders with only 3 traps.

Players can gain up to around 80,000–85,000 experience per hour at level 60, increasing to around 100,000–105,000 experience per hour at level 67. Before level 60, players can only expect to gain around 55,000–60,000 experience per hour with 3 traps. If the player is using hunter potions to boost the Hunter level to be able to place 4 traps at a time, they will need approximately 10 hunter potions from level 57 to 60, or 2 hunter potions from level 59 to 60 (1 with Preserve prayer).

Players can break the set-trap animation by selecting another action as soon as the net and rope items are removed from their inventory. Accurately timing picking up your rope or setting a new trap mid-action to break the animation can help achieve higher experience rates. The default left-click action for the net portion of newly-set traps can be modified from "Dismantle" to "Walk here", which both prevents accidental dismantling of reset traps, and allows one to spam-click under their player (picking up rope/net) in order to cancel the animation. The "Reset" option can be used to dismantle and set the trap back up in one click, but it is slower than doing both actions manually.

Levels 67–73: Black salamanders
From level 67 to 73, catch black salamanders in the Boneyard Hunter area in the Wilderness. To get there, use a burning amulet teleport to the Chaos Temple and run north-east, or a games necklace teleport to the Corporeal Beast lair and run east. Bring 6 ropes and 6 small fishing nets. Set up five net traps onto the young trees, and drop the caught salamanders as soon as possible. With 6 ropes and nets, traps can be reset before picking up the collapsed ones.

While black salamanders are located in the Wilderness, the hunting area is not popular among player killers. If attacked, players can teleport away. 

Hunting in the Wilderness allows the player to use one additional trap compared to the usual limit, which means 5 at level 60.

Players can expect around 90,000–115,000 experience per hour at level 67, increasing to around 100,000–125,000 experience per hour at level 73. At level 79, it is possible to gain up to 140,000 experience per hour with good concentration, and rising as high as 150,000 with level 80 Hunter when utilising 6 net traps.

Level 75–99: Moonlight Moths
Capturing moonlight moths in the Northern section of the Earthbound Cavern in the ruins of Neypotzli is a click-intensive but fast way of levelling Hunter upon reaching level 75. Nets can be claimed from the supply crates nearby, and three moonlight moths are close enough to one another that by the time two have been captured, a third will have respawned. When run energy runs out, if the Perilous Moons quest has been completed, one can utilise the "Make-Cuppa" action at the cooking stove to fully restore their run energy.

One can expect upwards of 100k XP/h when capturing the moths, which will go up as hunter level improves. With a magic butterfly net, or barehanded, above Hunter 85, the catch rate is close to 100%.

Moonlight moths are also available in the basement of the Hunter Guild, which is closer to a bank for players wishing to sacrifice some  experience per hour to bank jarred moonlight moths, which can be used to restore Prayer points, or sold for .

Levels 63/80–99: Carnivorous chinchompas
Requires partial completion of the Eagles' Peak quest to be able to set box traps.
thumb|Player using the trap resetting technique.
Hunting carnivorous chinchompas is a profitable alternative that offers relatively fast experience. While this method can be started at level 63 (or lower if boosting), the experience rates and profit are much lower when hunting with only four traps before level 80. Players may find it worthwhile to train with other methods until level 80 and start hunting red chinchompas when the player can place five traps at a time.

The best location to hunt carnivorous chinchompas is in the Tlati Rainforest north-east of Tal Teklan. Accessing Varlamore requires completion of Children of the Sun. After completing Twilight's Promise, players can use a quetzal to Tal Teklan and run north-east to get there. Using other hunting locations is not recommended, as they offer worse experience rates due to sparser spawns.

Traps can be placed one tick faster via tick manipulation. When correctly timed, it is also possible to lay a trap instantly after picking up another. This is also known as trap resetting, which is done by moving to the desired spot on the same tick as laying the previous trap, picking up the next, and clicking it up as soon as possible in the inventory. Trap resetting will increase experience rates, but require more effort and accurate clicks. An alternative account can be used to shoot stray chinchompas for slightly higher rates.

Experience rates in the table below assume using the Tlati Rainforest hunting spot and having good practice with the method. Expect lower rates when learning. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to 230,000–235,000 experience per hour at level 99.

Levels 80–99: Herbiboar

Tracking the herbiboar on Fossil Island is a fairly low-effort alternative to the faster training methods. To track the herbiboar, inspect one of the starting points in the Mushroom Forest and follow the footsteps until they enter a burrow. Kick the burrow for Hunter experience and to make the stunned herbiboar appear outside the hole. Players can then optionally harvest the creature for herbs and a small amount of Herblore experience. There is also a 1/6,500 chance to obtain the Herbi pet when a player harvests the creature.

This method requires level 80 Hunter and level 31 Herblore, as well as completion of Bone Voyage to access Fossil Island. High Agility levels, Weight-reducing clothing, stamina potions, and optionally a ring of endurance are all useful here as the player spends most of their time running. If harvesting the herbiboar, also bring the magic secateurs (equipped or in the inventory) for an extra herb per harvest and the herb sack for longer trips. The 'Herbiboar Helper' on the New Official Client highlights the correct object to search, which will make maintaining high rates a lot easier.

Experience per herbiboar caught scales depending on the level. The rates in the table below assume 66 herbiboars caught per hour. Harvesting the herbiboar (with the magic secateurs) will also give 3,300 passive Herblore experience per hour.

===== Pay-to-play Mining training =====
This article provides an overview of strategies used to train the Mining skill.

Equipment
The only item required to mine is a pickaxe. A certain Attack level is required to wield one, but players can still use the pickaxe to mine without the Attack level requirement. Use the best pickaxe available for the fastest mining speed.

Using an infernal pickaxe is recommended if using the fastest training methods. Mining rocks with it will give a 1/3 chance for the ore to automatically combust, which will consume the ore. This reduces the number of ores that need to be dropped, and also grants some passive Smithing experience. Making an infernal pickaxe requires level 85 Smithing, and it can be charged with dragon pickaxes or smouldering stones. The former are usually cheaper, but using the infernal pickaxe can still be somewhat expensive for some players.

For other methods, the crystal pickaxe performs better, and it should be used if the player has enough crystal shards for it.

Pickaxes
Higher-tier pickaxes take less time between rolls while mining. Each tick is a period of 0.6 seconds. When the allotted time passes, the game will roll whether or not you mine something successfully. The chance itself is affected by the Mining level. The pickaxe tier does not affect the skilling success rate, only the time between rolls. For example, a bronze pickaxe has the same chance of mining successfully as a rune pickaxe, but rolls for a resource every 8 ticks instead of 3. However, the mining speed mechanic can be bypassed with tick manipulation. When using a knife on teak logs (or other suitable items), a bronze pickaxe can mine every 3 ticks instead of 8 when timed correctly.

Prospector kit

The Prospector kit obtained from Prospector Percy in the Motherlode Mine or from the Volcanic Mine Reward Shop provides a total of 2.5% bonus Mining experience when worn. The outfit is not worth getting timewise if the player is going for 99 Mining using the fastest methods. However, it is a requirement for a master clue step, and the helmet for a hard task in the Falador Diary, so the player might want to get it anyway.

The full set costs 180 nuggets or 120,000 Volcanic Mine reward points in total. Getting 180 nuggets takes around 10 hours on average.

Varrock armour
Completing task sets from the Varrock Diary grants the player Varrock armour, which gives the player 10% chance of mining 2 ores at once while worn. For the methods below, Varrock armour 1 provides this effect for mining iron, Varrock armour 2 for mining granite, and Varrock armour 4 for mining amethyst. However, the Varrock armour does not work at Motherlode Mine, Blast Mine, Volcanic Mine, or on gem rocks.

The Varrock armour 4 also works as a prospector jacket.

Other
Wearing a celestial ring, obtained through the Shooting Stars activity, provides an invisible +4 boost to the Mining skill. This will boost experience rates slightly. The uncharged ring is worth getting if the player is going for level 99 Mining using the methods below.

There are also mining gloves available in the Mining Guild. The expert mining gloves are worth getting if mining amethyst crystals.

Fastest experience
To gain Mining experience most efficiently, players should always drop the ores they mine (also known as "powermining" or "dropmining"). This can be done by holding the shift key and clicking on the ore once shift drop has been enabled in the options. Mobile users can toggle the tap-drop option.

Levels 1–37: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Mining experience. Completing Doric's Quest, The Dig Site, Plague City, The Giant Dwarf, The Lost Tribe and Another Slice of H.A.M. grants a total of 27,525 Mining experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 37. All of these quests have low requirements, and completing them allows the player to use an adamant pickaxe right from the start.

Levels 1–15: Copper/Tin ore
From level 1 to 15, mine copper or tin. This can be done anywhere, though the Lumbridge Swamp mining site is debatably the easiest due to its relative lack of players and aggressive monsters, and its collection of copper and tin rocks.

Levels 15–45/70: Iron ore
thumb|Mining iron in the Mining Guild.
From level 15 to 45, mine iron. Players who are inexperienced with tick manipulation methods, or do not plan to use tick manipulation at all, are advised to mine iron up to level 70 and continuing with other methods such as the Volcanic Mine.

Wearing Varrock armour 1 or higher increases the overall experience rate for this method, as it gives the player 10% chance to mine 2 ores at once while worn.

From level 15 to 60, mine iron at a location that has three iron rocks in a triangle. This formation allows the player to mine all three rocks without moving. Drop the ores while waiting for the rocks to respawn. There are 13 such locations available at this level: 

 Legends' Guild Mine
 Al Kharid Mine
 Piscatoris Mine
 Lovakengj Mine
 Verdant Valley
 Mount Karuulm Mine
 Resource Area (level 51 Wilderness)
 South Mor Ul Rek Mine
 Isle of Souls
 Sisterhood Sanctuary Mine
 Stranglewood Mine
 Cam Torum Mine
 Salvager Overlook Mine (east)

If using tick manipulation, the best place to mine iron is in the Legends' Guild mine or the Isle of Souls mine. Both locations have 4 iron rocks close to each other. Start the 3-tick cycle with a herb and tar (or other suitable items) while moving between rocks, and drop the ores in between mines. Because this method is much harder and more advanced than using a triangle spot, it is only recommended for players who plan on 3-tick mining granite from level 45 onwards.

From level 60 onwards, the pay-to-play area of the Mining Guild becomes the best option, as the respawn time for rocks mined in this area is halved. This makes it so the players do not have to wait for the rocks to respawn or use tick manipulation. With correct timing and accurate clicks, players can drop the ore between mines and keep mining continuously.

Players can gain around 45,000–55,000 experience per hour below level 60 when not using tick manipulation. From level 60 and above, the maximum experience rate in the Mining Guild caps at around 70,000–80,000 experience per hour, depending on performance and the pickaxe used.

Banking the ores is not recommended as this slows down experience rates a lot and the iron ores are usually not worth very much. Ironmen who wish to bank their ores are advised to use the pay-to-play area in the Mining Guild, which has a triangle spot near to the bank chest. For those below level 60, an alternative location to bank iron ores is the  Monastery Mine, using the Ardougne cloak to teleport to the mine and then a bank teleportation method such as the Ring of dueling teleport to Castle Wars to bank your ore.

Levels 45–99: Granite
thumb|3-tick granite mining in action.
3-tick mining granite (commonly referred to as "3t4g", 3-tick 4 granite) at the Quarry offers the fastest Mining experience from level 45 onwards. 3-tick mining is done by using swamp tar on a clean herb (or other suitable items) to set up the 3-tick cycle and then moving to a granite rock to mine it. When timed correctly, the player will skip the delay from moving to the granite rock and has a chance to receive a rock every three ticks. The player will need to move between four granite rocks to continuously keep up the 3-tick cycle.

While 3-tick mining granite offers the fastest experience, it is very click-intensive and can be hard to learn. This method is not worth doing without tick manipulation, as the experience rates would be much lower. Players who are new to tick manipulation methods may find it worthwhile to train with iron before attempting to train with granite, as mining iron offers relatively high rates at lower levels.

Experience rates shown in the table below assume wearing the Varrock armour, the prospector kit, and an uncharged celestial ring. The rate at level 99 also assumes wearing the Mining cape. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to 134,000 experience per hour at level 99, though players are more likely to see rates closer to around 120,000–125,000 experience per hour when including some mistakes. Without tick manipulation players can only gain around 63,000 experience per hour at best.

  level  XP/h  XP/h () 45 87,000  55 95,000  65 103,000 7,700 75 109,000 8,200 85 114,000 8,700 95 119,000 9,100 99 126,000 9,700

Setup and tips

To get to the Quarry, teleport with the Camulet to Enakhra's Temple, navigate outside, and run a short distance south-west. After completing the hard Desert Diary, players can teleport straight to the entrance instead. Players who have not completed Enakhra's Lament can use the Pharaoh's sceptre to teleport to the Ancient Pyramid and run west, take the ferry to the Ruins of Unkah and run north, or take the carpet to Bedabin Camp and run south. Alternatively, players who have started Beneath Cursed Sands can use the spot at the Necropolis mine near the fairy ring .

Players must have some sort of desert heat protection to survive, such as
 Wearing the Desert amulet 4.
 Wearing the Hitpoints cape with a regen bracelet, which will outheal the damage taken from desert heat.
 Bringing waterskins and filling them with the lunar spell Humidify.
 Wearing the circlet of water. This comes at the cost of 0.4% experience bonus from the Prospector helmet and 0.5% from the Prospector outfit set bonus.  

Wearing Varrock armour 2 or higher gives the player 10% chance to mine 2 ores at once while worn, which will increase experience rates. Varrock armour 4 also acts as a prospector jacket for the prospector kit experience bonus.

Using the infernal pickaxe is strongly recommended if the player can afford it, as it reduces the amount of ores that need to be dropped and also provides passive Smithing experience. One fully charged infernal pickaxe lasts for around 960,000 Mining experience. It can be charged with smouldering stones or dragon pickaxes, with the smouldering stone currently costing  and the dragon pickaxe .

If not using the infernal pickaxe, the pickaxe tier does not matter as it does not affect mining success rates. Because tick manipulation bypasses the normal pickaxe rate for mining rolls, the crystal pickaxe does not bring any benefits for this method.

To minimise mouse movement, make the game client as small as possible and use the 'Modern' resizable client layout. Zoom in and turn the camera south so that there is as little distance from the inventory to the rocks as possible. Turning data orbs off is also helpful to prevent any misclicks when clicking on the southernmost rock.

Players should drop the mined pieces of granite on the ground between mines. This is done by starting the 3-tick action and clicking on the next rock, quickly dropping the granite and clicking the rock again. This requires accurate clicking and some practice to perform consistently, but it is much more efficient than dropping a full inventory.

Moreover, it is recommended to only drop 1 or 2 rocks at a time to avoid clicking the next rock too late. Because of how movement stalls work with tick manipulation, moving to the next rock will grant a second roll for a resource if the first one fails. This makes the player more likely to receive a rock. However, if the player clicks on the next rock too late, they will miss out on the additional roll and are less likely to receive a rock. Note that this mechanic is separate from mining enhancers, and the chance to get extra rocks from Varrock armour (or other mining enhancers) is applied after getting a successful roll.

Other methods
Levels 30–99: Motherlode Mine
275x275px|right
Mining in the Motherlode Mine is a profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. To do this, mine ore veins inside the mine, deposit the pay-dirt into the hopper to clean it, and repeat. Once the sack is full, empty it and bank the ores for profit. The veins deplete after 36–40 seconds in the upper level, or 23–27 seconds in the lower level. At higher levels, this method is only recommended for players who are looking for a straightforward training method, as the Volcanic Mine minigame offers faster experience.

To get there, use a skills necklace teleport to the Mining Guild and run a short distance to the entrance. Players will need a pickaxe to clear the obstructing rockfalls to enter deeper into the mine.

Completing the medium Falador Diary grants the player access to a shortcut (requires level 54 Agility) to an area which is near the bank chest and relatively close to the hopper. Completion of the elite diary will also increase the chance of receiving higher-level ores.

Players can obtain golden nuggets through cleaning pay-dirt, which can be used to purchase perks and rewards from Prospector Percy. The most notable reward is the Prospector kit, which adds a bonus 2.5% experience while mining. Purchasing the prospector helmet is required for the hard Falador Diary. Unlock the upper levels of the mine as soon as it becomes available. 

Experience rates vary depending on the Mining level and what upgrades have been unlocked. At level 90 with a dragon pickaxe and a celestial ring, prospector kit, with the upgraded sack, the upper level unlocked and the upper chute unlocked, players can gain around 62,000 experience per hour.

For more up to date calculations on profit per hour, see Motherlode Mine.

Levels 40–99: Gem rocks
thumb|Tick manipulation at gem rocks
Mining gem rocks is a profitable alternative that offers comparable experience rates to granite when using tick manipulation. Gem rocks are also the fastest method on average to obtain the rock golem pet. Without tick manipulation, this method is considerably slower and only recommended for ironmen who need opals, jades, or red topazes.

For this method, players will need to have completed the medium Karamja Diary for access to the underground portion of the Shilo Village mine. The area has many gem rocks and a bank deposit box nearby. Without the diary completion this method is not worth doing, as the surface area has much fewer rocks. Wearing a charged amulet of glory is also required for the fastest rates. Having the gem bag is recommended to reduce dropping and banking.

The experience rates in the table below assume wearing a charged amulet of glory and the prospector kit. At maximum rates players can expect  profit per hour.

 levelXP/h (3-tick) XP/h (w/o 3-tick) 5093,00046,0006097,00052,00070101,00058,00080105,00066,00090107,00070,00099110,00075,000

Levels 41–99: Calcified rocks
Mining calcified rocks in the Cam Torum Mine is a low-effort alternative to the faster methods. This method requires having started Perilous Moons. The rocks deplete after around 70 seconds. Occasionally, water starts oozing temporarily from some of the veins, and mining those veins will increase the success rate of mining rocks. Additionally, players can receive a calcified deposit from mining the rocks which when opened with a hammer on an anvil provide the player with 6-20 additional bone shards or a chance to receive a tradeable and stackable calcified moth. Crushing the moth will teleport the player directly to Cam Torum.

Players can gain up to 50,000 experience and roughly 3,000 blessed bone shards per hour at level 99.  With tick manipulation, players can gain up to around 94,000 experience and 5,500 bone shards per hour at level 99.

Levels 60–99: Crashed stars
Mining crashed stars is a very low-effort alternative to the faster methods. As part of the Shooting Stars Distraction and Diversion, a shooting star will fall at a random spot selected from a predetermined list. Once the player has found a crashed star, they can mine it for 42–63 minutes depending on its tier before the star depletes. Each tier can be mined for seven minutes without interaction, only requiring the player to click again whenever the star degrades a tier.

There are a few issues this method faces if one chooses to efficiently train on crashed stars. Depending on the size of the star, players need to have a secondary activity planned after fully mining stars to depletion. Using an oak telescope or better in a study room of a player-owned house can display a timeframe for when the star will fall, as well as the region it will land in. Stars may also fall in the Wilderness and in other dangerous areas, which are not recommended to train on. Switching worlds or receiving information from other players/clans may also help to scout for new crashed stars.

This method is fully available at level 60 Mining since the lowest star falls at tier 6, but it can begin at level 10 if the star is mined down to a suitable tier. The stardust can be exchanged for a celestial ring, which gives an invisible +4 boost to Mining. Considering the Grand Exchange price of soft clay, each stardust is worth  when using the stardust to buy soft clay packs.

If stardust is used to charge the celestial ring and is taken to efficient Granite mining, each hour of mining stardust is worth ~10k xp/h more and can give 140k xp/h with good clicks.

Experience and stardust rates are shown in the table below. The rates include the time spent finding a new star as well as some idle time whenever the star degrades a tier. While it's possible to use tick manipulation for higher rates, doing so is not recommended for this method (except for obtaining stardust as quickly as possible) as there are much better options for high-effort training.

Levels 70–99: Volcanic Mine

275x275px|right
The Volcanic Mine minigame on Fossil Island is a fairly low-effort alternative that offers relatively fast experience. In the mine, the goal is to mine the boulder to obtain ore fragments for Petrified Pete while keeping the mine stable. This grants Mining experience and points for the reward shop. Doing the minigame efficiently requires coordinated teamwork and it does not provide any significant profit, however.

To access Fossil Island, players must have completed the Bone Voyage quest. Players must also pay Petrified Pete 30 numulites every time they wish to enter the mine. Alternatively, pay a one-time fee of 3000 numulites for permanent access. While the mine can be accessed at level 50 Mining, having at least level 70 is recommended for better experience rates. Good food is also required, as players take heavy damage in the mine.

The official world for this minigame is World 323, although it is recommended to search for a team — the Grouping interface includes a clan chat for Volcanic Mine, where players may be found making groups. Having 3 to 5 players in a team is optimal, although duo is viable as well. Soloing is also possible, but it requires much more effort and practice, and the experience rates are slightly lower than in a team.

Experience rates shown in the table below assume having a consistent 3–5-player team. The rates an vary depending on the role performed and the team's performance. Players also can gain up to around 15,400–17,200 points per hour at the maximum listed rates. When using dedicated boosting accounts, it is possible to gain up to 105,000 experience per hour at level 99.

Levels 70–99: Zalcano
thumb|280px|Two players mine Zalcano after breaking her stone armour.
Zalcano is a demon imprisoned beneath Prifddinas that is fought using skilling rather than conventional combat. Being immune to traditional combat damage, players must use their Mining, Smithing and Runecraft skills to create imbued tephra capable of destroying her stone armour. Once her armour has been destroyed, they must damage her by mining her with a pickaxe.

Zalcano can be a viable training option for players past level 70 Mining who are seeking an engaged and challenging training method. Players should be advised that in order to fight Zalcano, they will need to unlock Prifddinas by completing the grandmaster quest Song of the Elves.

Speaking to Rhiannon allows players to toggle between resource rewards and increased experience. Toggling resources off still rolls for unique and pet rewards.
 If resource drops are enabled, players can expect to get roughly 13,500 Mining, 3,000 Smithing and 1,500 Runecraft experience per hour when killing Zalcano efficiently.
 If resource drops are disabled, players can expect to get roughly 50,000 Mining experience per hour, scaling up with Mining level. At level 80 Mining, players can expect at least 70,000 Mining experience per hour. In small teams of 3 to 5, players can obtain around 90,000 xp per hour.

Levels 75–99: Blast Mine
275x275px|right
The Blast Mine minigame is a profitable alternative that offers fast experience. At level 75, players are able to obtain runite which makes the bulk of the profit gained. While it is possible to participate in the minigame below level 75, this is not recommended as the lack of runite ores will severely hamper experience and profit rates.

Having a higher Mining level increases the chances of obtaining better ores, increasing experience and profit as a result.

Blast mining requires numerous dynamite, a chisel, and a tinderbox. Wear weight-reducing clothing (such as the graceful outfit) and a charged ring of endurance to reduce run energy drain, and use stamina potions to restore run energy if needed. Having a pickaxe is not necessary, but the dragon pickaxe's special attack can be used to temporarily increase the current Mining level to have a higher chance of receiving better ores. The Prospector kit can be worn for extra experience when collecting the ores from the operator.

Experience rates depend on Mining level and strategy. Players can gain between 65,000–76,000 experience per hour at level 75, increasing to 87,000–101,000 experience per hour at level 99.

Levels 78–99: Infernal Shale
275x275px|thumb

Infernal shale can be mined in the Chasm of Fire with level 78 Mining. It is crushed into crushed infernal shale with a hammer and a chisel, which is used to create Oathplate armour. A Kingdom Divided is required to mine the rocks. Infernal shale is untradeable and must be crushed in order to trade, providing no experience.

The experience gained from each rock varies, with each rock giving between 13.2 and 100 experience. For more information, see the infernal shale page. The average amount of experience per rock mined is 43.67 or 44.75, depending on whether the player is using the Prospector kit.

The mining method is usually not recommended as experience rates are very low unless using tick manipulation with Jim's wet cloth, and even then it's very high intensity for a maximum of 67,000 - 80,000 experience per hour (with a hypothetical maximum of 90,000, yet this is unrealistic).

The main draw for this method is that it can provide more than  per hour with significant mining experience if the user is willing to put in the work.

For more information on this activity, visit the money making guide and Jim's wet cloth page.

Levels 92–99: Amethyst
Amethyst is an alternative choice for players looking to mine with low effort or click intensity, albeit for very slow experience rates. Depending on concentration and the tier of pickaxe used, players can expect to mine from 80 to 100 amethyst per hour, for approximately 20,000–25,000 experience per hour and around  profit per hour.

Post 99
After level 99, experience rates will remain constant. Assuming that the player is wearing full prospector, a celestial signet, Varrock armour 4, a charged amulet of glory, a Mining skillcape, Expert mining gloves and is using either a dragon or crystal pickaxe, the table below provides some expected rates of experience per hour:

===== Free-to-play Mining training =====
This guide outlines the best methods for training the Mining skill in free-to-play. Even though mining runite ore with 85 Mining is one of the fastest free-to-play money making methods, profit from lower level ores is very low so it is more efficient to drop mined ores when training and use the saved time for other money making methods.

Pickaxes
Pickaxes are required to train Mining, ranging from bronze to rune. Each tier up decreases the tick interval between rolls to mine an ore and thus it is recommended to always use the highest tier pickaxe available. If the Attack level requirement is met, save an inventory space by equipping the pickaxe.

Levels 1–99
Level 1–10: Doric's Quest
It is recommended to complete Doric's Quest early on for the reward of 1,300 Mining experience, enough to level Mining from 1 to 10. It can be completed immediately by already having the required materials, 6 clay, 4 copper ore, and 2 iron ore.

While the clay and copper ore can be mined easily at level 1, the iron ore requires level 15 to mine. However, it can be obtained easily from the Grand Exchange or as an uncommon drop from dwarves which can be found near the Dwarven Mines to the east of Doric's house.

Levels 1/10–15: Copper ore/Tin ore
 Mine copper and tin rocks to 15 Mining for 17.5 each. If banking the ores for Smithing, mine at the South-east Varrock mine and bank in the eastern Varrock bank, otherwise the safest and easiest location are East Lumbridge Swamp mine or the northern Dwarven Mines

 Starting experience: 0

 Copper ore or tin ore required for 15 from 0: 138 (2,415 experience)
 Starting experience at 10: 1,300
 Experience needed for 15 from 10: 1,111
 Copper ore or tin ore required for 15 from 10: 64 (1,120 experience)

Levels 15–99: Iron ore
 The fastest experience from this point onward is from iron rocks for 35 experience each. Maximise experience by dropping ores and from mining at locations where one tile is surrounded by three iron rocks for zero travel time while waiting for respawns. At 41 Mining with a rune pickaxe all three ores can be mined and the player can face back towards the first just before it respawns, allowing for non-stop mining. The only location in free-to-play with one tile surrounded by three iron ores is Al Kharid Mine, which has aggressive level 14 scorpions.

At 41 Mining, the maximum experience rate is around 50,000 experience per hour. At 61 Mining, the chance of successfully harvesting the iron ore becomes 100% - as iron rocks take 5.4 seconds (9 ticks) to respawn, this means that three iron ores can be mined every 12 ticks (3 tick mining time and 9 tick respawn time). The maximum experience rate is 52,500 experience per hour. Using Tick manipulation with food such as cakes the experience rate can increase to a maximum of 68,000 experience per hour 3t cake mining example (65k+ xp/hr) (Youtube) by using an alt or a runner to replenish the food as you run out.

4-tick mining can also be performed by using leather and a needle with thread in the inventory. This allows continuously mining 3 iron rocks every 12 ticks in other locations, such as the Citharede Abbey mine, where 3 rocks are located so that each can be reached in 1-2 ticks from the previous in the cycle.

Money making methods
Levels 30–99: Superheat Item
 Superheat Item can be used at 43 Magic and the appropriate Smithing level to smelt a bar without a furnace. This reduces the need to bank when Mining, especially for coal. Equip a staff of fire, and keep Nature runes and a pickaxe in the inventory for 26 open spaces. If purchasing the ore, bring 26 minus the amount of coal required to superheat the bar, otherwise, mine them as you mine coal. This will allow mining of a significant amount of coal between trips to the bank while producing bars:

Bar# of barsper trip# of coal minedper tripProfit per barProfit per tripProfit to 99244822882012018144With an  imbued Skull sceptre, the Barbarian Village mine has the closest coal rocks, and banking can be done with the Falador teleport. With a high Mining level, hopping worlds or using a different location may be required due to mining speed and coal respawn time. Otherwise, the time save is significant.

Alternative locations with an abundance of coal included: the Mining Guild, the West Lumbridge Swamp mine, the South-west Wilderness mine, and the Dwarven mine for additional mining locations. With this method, some mines located farther away than others from a bank become more viable due to bank travel taking up proportionally less time.

Levels 70–85: Adamantite ore
 Mining adamantite ore can be a good free-to-play money-making method. The best place to mine adamantite is within the Mining Guild, requiring 70 Mining. It has two rocks and ores can be banked at the east Falador bank. Hopping worlds is faster than waiting for them to respawn. Mining adamantite rocks give 95 experience each. See Money making guide/Mining adamantite ore (free-to-play) for more information.

 Starting experience: 737,627
 Experience required: 1,935,487
 Adamantite ore required: 20,374 (1,935,530 experience)
 Profit: 

Levels 85–99: Runite ore
 Runite mining is highly profitable, but extremely slow and dangerous because the only runite rocks are in the Wilderness at the Lava Maze runite mine. Like adamantite, it is faster and safer to hop worlds instead of waiting for ores to respawn. Mining runite rocks give 125 experience each. See Money making guide/Mining runite ore (free-to-play) for more information.

 Starting experience: 3,258,610

Other methods
Levels 1/10–14/15: Rune essence
 With the completion or progression of Rune Mysteries, players can mine rune essences at the rune essence mine to create runes for Runecraft training later or drop them for faster Mining rates. As for training Mining, this is a slow training method with each rune essence giving 5 experience (a total of 140 Mining experience per inventory) but it's the only AFK-able training method until the player can access the Ruins of Camdozaal after completing Below Ice Mountain.

 Starting experience: 0
 Experience needed for 15 from 0: 2,411

 Starting experience at 10: 1,300
 Experience needed for 15 from 10: 953 or 1,111
 Rune essence required for 15 from 10: 223 (1,115 experience)

Levels 10–99: Crashed stars
Crashed Stars are part of the Shooting Stars Distraction and Diversion. Mining them yields low experience per hour, but is very AFK, as you can mine for seven minutes before having to click again when it degrades a tier. Expect approximately 8,000-13,000 experience per hour at level 70. In free-to-play it is much more difficult to find stars, so it is recommended to join a group that shares locations, such as the Shooting Stars chat channel on the game's chat interface. There are also several RuneLite plugins that can help F2P players and members alike in finding stars. Otherwise, for F2P players, world hopping at locations is required to find stars which can be difficult and take a lot of time.

Levels 14–99: Barronite shards and deposits
 Completing the free-to-play Below Ice Mountain quest rewards the player with access to the Ruins of Camdozaal where you can mine barronite shards from barronite rocks. Mining barronite shards gives 16 experience each and mining barronite deposits gives 32 experience each, making this a slower training method than mining iron ore but it is very AFK-able compared to iron ore, making barronites a good training alternative to iron ore and an improvement over mining rune essence. Barronite shards can be used to purchase rewards from Ramarno and while the barronite deposits can be used for Smithing, dropping them is recommended if solely training Mining.

Purchasing the permanent Charm of Mining buff and the one-hour Charm of Boost from Ramarno's Shard Exchange yields higher experience rates.

Observed experience rates at level 75 Mining with both buffs active is around 18,000–20,000 experience per hour.

===== Pay-to-play Smithing training =====
This article gives tips about training Smithing.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–39: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Smithing experience. Completing The Knight's Sword, Sleeping Giants, Elemental Workshop I and II, The Giant Dwarf, Heroes' Quest, and Freeing Pirate Pete subquest of Recipe for Disaster grants a total of 36,982 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 39. Players would then only need to smith 2 iron platebodies to get level 40 Smithing, where they can start smelting gold bars in the Blast Furnace. Even without Heroes' Quest, this method yields 34,725 experience, requiring players to make only 20 iron platebodies to get to level 40. Notably, The Knight's Sword grants 12,725 experience and can be completed in less than 10 minutes.

Levels 1–40: Anvil smithing
From level 1 to 40, smith various items at the anvil just south of the west Varrock bank. Make the highest-level item available for the fastest experience rates. Higher-levelled items require more than one bar to make, fewer actions will be required and this will result in more experience per hour. This will result in a loss, but the overall loss is relatively small as reaching level 40 would only take less than an hour.

The items and materials needed to reach level 40 are shown in the table below. While there are some items which are potentially cheaper to make, these low-level items are uncommonly traded on the Grand Exchange and their prices fluctuate a lot. Players who wish to save money are advised to do quests that give Smithing experience to skip most of the early levels.

Levels 40–99: Blast Furnace gold bars

Smelting gold bars at the Blast Furnace becomes the fastest viable training method at level 40. This method costs money, and it can be fairly expensive depending on the Grand Exchange prices.

For optimal rates, players will need goldsmith gauntlets for more experience per gold ore (increased from 22.5 to 56.2) and ice gloves to quickly cool the bar dispenser. The goldsmith gauntlets require completion of Family Crest, and the ice gloves level 50 Mining (boostable) and killing the Ice Queen. Use stamina potions to restore run energy. If available, also wear weight-reducing clothing and the ring of endurance with at least 500 charges to reduce run energy consumption.

To gain access to Keldagrim, talk to the Dwarven Boatman inside the dungeon east of Rellekka to start The Giant Dwarf. Once the quest has been started, players can get to the Blast Furnace by using the Grouping teleport there or using the minecart from the Grand Exchange to Keldagrim. Use one of the official Blast Furnace worlds where dwarf NPCs will keep the furnace running for 72,000 coins per hour. Below level 60, the Blast Furnace Foreman will require a payment every 10 minutes to be able to use the furnace.

To start off, deposit an inventory of gold ore into the ore belt while wearing goldsmith gauntlets; this is done to fill the bar dispenser and ensure that, with sufficient speed, you will never have to wait for the bar dispenser to be full. After that, this method goes as follows:
 Withdraw an inventory of gold ore at the bank chest and deposit it into the conveyor belt.
 AFTER the gold bars smelt and you gain experience (ensuring the goldsmith gauntlet experience rate), equip the ice gloves and quickly run to the bar dispenser to grab the bars.
 Deposit the gold bars at the bank and withdraw more gold ore.  Re-equip goldsmith gauntlets.
 Withdraw a stamina potion dose and drink it on the way to the conveyor belt to restore run energy when needed.

The experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The experience rates can vary depending on performance. The costs include the hourly Blast Furnace fee and the profit from selling the gold bars, and assume using 40 stamina potion doses per hour.

MethodXP/hGP/hGP/XPOres needed(40–99) Total profit(40–99)Goldsmith gauntlets380,000231,267No goldsmith gauntlets164,000577,654Smithing cape410,000

To speed up banking, you can either:  
 lock the inventory slots where your goldsmith gauntlets or ice gloves are.
OR 
 clear the placeholders for goldsmith gauntlets and ice gloves, and fill the bank with bank fillers. This way, the player can quickly deposit the bars without depositing any necessary items.

Additionally to both options, have gold ore and 1-dose stamina potions near the 'Deposit inventory' button.

With fast and accurate clicks, players can minimise downtime with a technique called 0-tick banking. To do this, the player needs to deposit the bars, withdraw gold ore, and start running back to the conveyor belt on the same tick. The easiest way to start running back to the conveyor belt is to click through the chatbox on resizable client layout. Enable 'Transparent chatbox' and 'Click through transparent chatbox' in the settings. Consistent 0-tick banking will increase experience rates to 390,000 experience per hour, or 420,000 experience per hour when wearing the Smithing cape.

Gold bars can be smelted faster at the Blast Furnace by using one or three runners. Instead of banking for the ores, have runners trade more gold ore in exchange for gold bars. Because this method is very expensive, it is only recommended for wealthy players who wish to gain experience as fast as possible and do not mind spending a lot of money. This method also requires good coordination and accurate clicks, as the player will need to quickly accept trades and smelt bars at the furnace.

The experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The profit rates assume paying 7 million coins per hour per runner and paying for the gold ore.

MethodXP/hGP/XP1 runner530,0003 runners680,000

Other methods
For anvil smithing methods, the closest anvil to a bank is in the Trahaearn district of Prifddinas. Players who have not completed Song of the Elves should use the anvil just south of the west Varrock bank. The anvil just south of the Yanille bank is slightly farther than the one in Varrock.

The experience rates for anvil smithing depends on the type of metal being smithed and number of bars being used per item. The following table shows the calculated experience per hour of each type of metal bar vs. how many bars are used per item, assuming an optimal 11-tick bank time, as possible at the south-eastern Prifddinas bank. The cost and level requirements can be checked by using the Smithing tables. Note that this does not factor in the Smiths' Uniform, with which experience rates increase from about 15% to 25% depending on what is being smithed.

Levels 15–99: Giants' Foundry

Forging swords at the Giants' Foundry minigame is a lower-effort alternative to the faster methods. This method requires completion of Sleeping Giants. To forge a sword, get a commission from Kovac, set the moulds, fill the crucible with bars or metal items, and pour the molten metal to start refining the sword. Use the right tool at the right temperature to increase the sword's completion to 100%. Hand the finished sword to Kovac for Smithing experience, coins, and foundry reputation.

Use a mix of two metals for the best experience rates. Mithril-adamantite swords are generally the best option for experience rates and cost. An 18/10 ratio to achieve 89 metal quality allows for higher experience per hour and less attention required at the cost of slightly more bars used. Adamantite-runite swords are only recommended for players who wish to obtain the unique rewards as quickly as possible, as they are usually much more expensive and only offer slightly faster experience than mithril-adamantite swords.

Buy the improved moulds first (that you have the Smithing levels to use) and then the Smiths' Uniform. The improved moulds increase the sword quality substantially, which increases experience rates and effectively lowers the material costs. The optimal mould unlock order can be seen here. Wearing the full Smiths' Uniform will increase the experience rates by roughly 5%. Run energy is restored with each sword completed, so the Graceful outfit is not beneficial in this activity.

The table below shows the average experience and gold rates for optimal alloys, with the average scoring of commissions, all optimal moulds, optimal player performance, and without the Smiths' Uniform. The performance and the commissions issued will vary, and so these rates may also slightly vary hour-to-hour, albeit within 10% of deviation. Similarly, changes in Grand Exchange market prices will also result in changes in expenses and thus profits.

Unless stated otherwise, the alloys are in a 1:1 ratio. Due to optimal moulds requiring up to level 81 Smithing, this Smithing level is assumed for this table. Claws are not considered as smelting material due to their low trading volumes.

Levels 15–99: Blast Furnace
Smelting bars (other than gold or silver) at the Blast Furnace offers slow experience, but it usually provides decent profit. Having the ice gloves and coal bag is strongly recommended to significantly increase the number of bars created per hour. Players will also need weight-reducing clothing and stamina potions to always have run energy. Optimal bar patterns can be found on the Blast Furnace page. The capital required to run the furnace for a full hour may be considerable for some players.

Experience and profit rates are listed in the table below. The numbers assume using one of the official worlds, having the coal bag, wearing ice gloves, and using 36 stamina potion doses per hour.

Levels 20–99: Smithing dart tips
Smithing dart tips offers very slow experience, but it requires very little attention. This method usually breaks even or makes a small profit due to their high demand for their use of training Fletching. The player must have completed The Tourist Trap quest to be able to smith dart tips. 10 dart tips are created per bar. A full inventory takes 81 seconds to process using Make-X.

Experience and profit rates are listed in the table below. The numbers assume 13,000 dart tips are made per hour when wearing the Smiths' Uniform and 10,600 dart tips made per hour without set.

Levels 35–99: Smithing cannonballs
Smithing cannonballs offers even slower experience than dart tips, but requires even less attention, and usually makes a profit. 4 cannonballs are created per steel bar; a double ammo mould smelts two steel bars at once, doubling the experience rates. A full inventory takes 160 seconds to process using Make-X, or roughly half that with a double ammo mould.

Experience and profit rates are listed in the table below. The numbers assume 2,400 cannonballs are made per hour, or twice that with a double ammo mould.
Level MouldXP/HourProfit/HourProfit/XP3513,8243527,648

Levels 48–99: Smithing armour
Smithing armour at an anvil is only recommended for account builds that cannot get goldsmith gauntlets. Depending on the Grand Exchange prices, adamant platebodies can be a viable alternative to smelting gold bars at the Blast Furnace as they offer relatively fast experience rates. Smith the highest-tier platebody available, starting from steel platebodies at level 48, moving to mithril at level 68 and then to adamant at level 88. From level 66 to 68, players can smith mithril platelegs or plateskirts as a slightly slower but cheaper alternative to steel platebodies.

Due to low buy limits, some High Level Alchemy focused clan chats (commonly found in Varrock west bank of world 308) may offer to buy in bulk for a better rate than the Grand Exchange price, benefiting both seller and buyer. This can lower the loss from making low-level armour, and potentially make Smithing a profitable activity doing adamant platebodies to level 99.

Players will need to have level 99 to be able to make these items, but Kovac's grog (starting from level 95) or Dwarven stout (starting from level 98) can be used to boost for that level. Each of these smithed items yields the same amount of experience, so players should make whatever offers the best profit. Players may also cast High Level Alchemy to increase profits, however this is only recommended if you have a lot of disposable gold.

Assuming 60 grogs used at level 95, 900 items smithed per hour and alching the items, this would yield  per hour with an expected GP/XP of ;- When using preserve this would decrease to 40 grogs or  per hour with an expected GP/XP of  (  and  GP/XP at level 96 and 97 respectively), while normal dwarven stouts at 98 would yield  for a GP/XP of .

===== Free-to-play Smithing training =====
This guide outlines the best methods for training the Smithing skill in free-to-play. There are a few ways to profit with Smithing in free-to-play, such as smelting bars or making rune equipment, however it is more beneficial to simply perform the fastest experience methods and use the saved time to make money from alternative methods.

Fastest experience
General Advice

When making equipment with bars, experience gained is based off the number of bars used, therefore using larger amounts of bars at once yields the highest experience rates. This means smithing platebodies when available is always the fastest experience per tier of bar. The best place to smith bars is the anvil south of Varrock west bank, as it is the closest anvil to a bank in free-to-play. Energy potions () can optionally be brought in the two empty inventory spaces when making platebodies to continuously sprint with level 1 Agility, at an added cost of roughly  per bar (1 energy potion dose per 32.5 bars). Depending on starting gp and profit from making certain platebodies, one can gain much more gold per hour as well as experience per hour using energy potions instead of letting run energy recharge naturally by walking.

An option available to players with 55 Magic is to cast High Level Alchemy on their created platebodies to either reduce costs, increase profits, or gain Magic experience. If choosing to alch their platebodies, then it is possible to alch 1-2 platebodies efficiently as a zero time Magic training method on the run from the anvil back to the bank. For this, one should equip a staff of fire and bring nature runes in place of one of their energy potions while smithing. Otherwise, the platebodies can be alched later, on their own or during other activities such as combat.

Level 1-29: The Knight's Sword
It is highly recommended to complete The Knight's Sword quest immediately for the reward of 12,725 Smithing experience, enough to level Smithing from 1 to 29.

Level 18/29-33: Bronze platebodies
 Smith bronze platebodies from level 18 (or 29 if The Knight's Sword has been completed) to 33 for 5 bars and 62.5 experience each. Smithing bronze platebodies at the anvil south of Varrock west bank gives experience rates of 50,000 Smithing XP per hour constantly running. Since bronze platebodies are smithed from 5 bars each, energy potions can be used in the two empty inventory spaces to continuously sprint while training.

Level 68-88: Mithril platebodies
 Smith mithril platebodies from levels 68 to 88 for 250 experience each. Smithing mithril platebodies at the anvil south of Varrock west bank gives experience rates of 200,000 Smithing XP per hour constantly running. Since mithril platebodies are smithed from 5 bars each, energy potions can be used in the two empty inventory spaces to continuously sprint while training.

Levelling smithing from level 68 to 88 takes smithing 15,123 mithril platebodies.

Level 87/88-98: Adamant platebodies
 Smith adamant platebodies from levels 88 to 98 for 312.5 experience each. Alternatively, from level 87 Smithing players can also boost to 88 for adamant platebodies with dwarven stout. Adamant platebodies give up to 250,000 experience per hour with the use of energy potions. Smithing adamant platebodies from levels 87/88 to 98/99 may take upwards of 35-45 hours depending on efficiency and use of energy potions.

Note: The next section for rune platebodies is helpful and slightly faster experience per hour. However, most players will opt to continue smithing adamant platebodies all the way to level 99 even though rune platebodies are more experience per item, as adamant platebodies may be cheaper experience per gold spent for comparable XP rates.

Starting at level 88:
 Starting experience: 4,385,787.5
 Experience required: 7,419,818.5
 Ending experience: 11,805,787

Level 98-99: Rune platebodies
 Starting at level 98, smith rune platebodies for the fastest experience at level 98 for 375 experience each by drinking a dwarven stout for a +1 Smithing boost for one minute. Maintain energy with energy potions. This will give experience rates of up to 300,000 Smithing experience per hour. However, rune platebodies can be extremely expensive despite offering the highest experience gained per hour for free-to-play Smithing training.

Starting at level 98:
 Starting experience: 11,805,787.5

Level 20-88: Smelting and Crafting
Crafting gold jewellry (and silver jewellry) is a potentially profitable way to train Crafting. If you're already making jewellry, you can use gold ore (or silver ore) to first make a gold bar (or silver bar). While this is a significantly slower overall method of training smithing, the marginal time cost of smelting is simply the smelting itself (because you already have to make trips between the bank and furnace anyway). Your effective marginal smelting rate is 1200 bars an hour (one bar every 5 ticks); or potentially even more, as the increased time per bank trip allows run energy to recover sustainably.

Level 70-99: Superheat Item
Players with level  can cast superheat item, which can smelt a bar from anywhere at its normal ore cost, plus 1 nature rune and 4 fire runes (no fire runes are necessary with a staff of fire equipped). This saves time travelling between the furnace and bank. Also, it only has a 3 tick cast time (1.8 seconds) rather than the standard 5 ticks (3 seconds) it takes to smelt a bar in a furnace. As such, it can process more bars per hour, earning Magic experience in addition to the normal Smithing xp. As a bonus, it successfully smelts iron bars 100% of the time, without needing a ring of forging.

One disadvantage of superheat item is that it does not auto-cast if you have the supplies to make multiple bars; it must be cast on each ore in the inventory, making this method more click intensive.

While this method is still considerably slower at gaining experience than the fastest experience mentioned above, it can be more cost effective.

This table assumes a staff of fire is equipped and each cycle takes ~4 seconds for banking.

Level 98-99: Smithing Rune Equipment
 Using a dwarven stout, players can boost from 98 to 99 Smithing and smith rune platelegs, rune plateskirts, and rune 2h swords as a potentially profitable alternative to adamant/rune platebodies. One dwarven stout must be drank every minute to maintain 99 Smithing from 98; this adds a cost of approximately one dwarven stout per 45 runite bars, or roughly  per bar. Currently, the most profitable 3 bar rune item to smith when selling on the Grand Exchange is . If casting High Level Alchemy after smithing, it does not matter whether rune platelegs, rune plateskirts, or rune 2h swords are made, as they have the same High Level Alchemy value.

Experience rates of approximately 215,000 Smithing experience per hour can be obtained from equipment made with 3 runite bars.

 AFK Methods 

 Level 1-99: Smelting Bars 
As stated at the start of this guide, if you are just looking to make money or train smithing as fast as possible, it is usually better to train smithing using the faster methods above and use the time saved on faster money makers. However, smelting bars can be a good method for players looking for an AFK method that also generates a profit. Be sure to check the GE before making any bars to make sure you will be making a profit instead of a loss. To use this method, it is recommended that you bank a large number of ores ahead of time: either by purchasing them from the GE, or mining them yourself if you don't have any gold or want the mining experience. Then head to the Edgeville Furnace as it is the closest furnace to a bank in free-to-play.

 Level 14+: Barronite Deposits 
 With 14 Mining and 14 Smithing, barronite deposits can be mined from barronite rocks in the Camdozaal Mines after completing the quest Below Ice Mountain. Using them on the special barronite crusher anvil near Ramarno with a hammer yields various rewards, including barronite shards and 30 Smithing experience. This method generates very slow smithing experience since the deposits are untradeable and must be mined before crushing. If you are also trying to AFK train Mining in Camdozaal, crushing deposits can be a good way to generate some additional Smithing experience, otherwise it is better to use any of the other methods in this guide. Since Smithing experience is directly tied to how quickly barronite deposits can be mined, a higher Mining level will lead to higher Smithing experience rates.

If using this method, the best technique is to keep a hammer and the highest tier pickaxe you can in your inventory and mine the barronite rocks until your inventory is full. If you have a high enough Attack level, wielding your pickaxe will give you an extra inventory slot for a deposit, however it is better to carry a higher tier pickaxe in your inventory than wielding a lower tier one. Once your inventory is full of deposits, head to the barronite crusher and crush all of the deposits for Smithing experience. You can drop any items you get from the deposits, or bank them at the bank chest east of Ramarno; however, since barronite shards stack, it is easiest just to leave them in your inventory for the entire session and use them to purchase buffs from Ramarno. The mining and boost buffs will increase your experience rates, and the luck buff will increase the odds of finding rare ancient artefacts when crushing deposits.

===== Pay-to-play Fishing training =====
This guide outlines the best methods for training the Fishing skill.

Equipment
Fishing uses two types of items, divided into consumables and equipment. Consumables are used up at the rate of one item for each fish caught and are stackable, while the equipment is non-stackable and reusable.

Net fishing: Small fishing net, not consumable.
Drift net fishing: Drift net, consumable. Recommended items: Flippers, diving apparatus, fishbowl helmet, and a Trident, as well as ways to restore run energy.
Bait fishing: Fishing rod and some fishing bait.
Fly fishing: Fly fishing rod and feathers for bait.
Harpooning: Harpoon (or just bare hands if you have completed Barbarian Training miniquest), not consumable. A Barb-tail harpoon is a wieldable alternative to the harpoon and saves an additional inventory space. The Dragon harpoon's special attack boosts fishing by 3 levels, and it can be used in conjunction with the Lightbearer to spam the special.
Cage fishing: Lobster pot, not consumable.
Vessel fishing: Karambwan vessel and usable bait: Karambwanji (requires a Small fishing net to catch).
Barbarian fishing: Barbarian rod and usable baits: fishing baits, feathers, fish offcuts, roe, or caviar.
Aerial Fishing: Cormorant and usable baits: king worms, fish chunks

You can also do Fishing Trawler minigame to get a set of Angler's outfit for an additional 2.5% more fishing experience gained per fish caught. But be warned that you may take many hours before getting the outfit.

Furthermore, for those players who are wanting to earn some money while fishing, you may want to acquire the Rada's blessing from the Kourend & Kebos diary. The easy, medium, hard, and elite diaries all give a 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% chance (respectively) of catching two fish at once. However, the player will not receive any experience from the extra fish that is caught. The blessing must be equipped while fishing for this to take effect.

The fish barrel stores up to 28 raw fish, making time between trips to the bank longer. The barrel can be obtained from the reward pool after fighting the Tempoross.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–24/33: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Fishing experience. Completing Sea Slug, Fishing Contest, and the Freeing Pirate Pete quest of Recipe for Disaster will grant a total of 10,612 experience, which will get the player up to level 27. All of these quests have few requirements and can be done at a low level, and completing them is a much better route for early Fishing levels than catching fish. Notably, the experience reward from Sea Slug is enough to get the player from level 1 to 24, and it is faster to complete the quest than catch low-level fish.

Completing Tai Bwo Wannai Trio and The Fremennik Trials will grant an additional 7,812 experience, which will get the player up to level 33, but they have higher requirements.

Levels 20–47/58: Fly fishing

3-tick fly fishing trout and salmon offers the fastest Fishing experience up to level 58 when using tick manipulation. Players will need a fly fishing rod and feathers to catch the fish. 3-tick fishing is done by using a herb on swamp tar (or other suitable items) and clicking on the fishing spot. When timed correctly, the player has a chance of receiving fish every three ticks instead of five. Drop the fish in between catches before clicking on the fishing spot.

Without tick manipulation this method is only recommended as a low-effort alternative past level 35, as Tempoross offers faster experience. At level 47, drift net fishing becomes better than 3-tick fly fishing if the player also needs to train Hunter.

Recommended fly fishing locations where the fishing spots have minimal movement or are useful otherwise:
South-east of the southern gate to Prifddinas, where the fishing spots do not move. The area requires partial completion of Regicide to access. After fully completing Regicide, players can quickly get there by using an Iorwerth camp teleport scroll and running east through the dense forest.
Shilo Village is the best location if banking the fish. The area requires completion of the Shilo Village quest to access. Alternatively Nemus Retreat offers a Bank to Players with Agility Levels of 24 right next to the fishing spots. With Level 36 Agility Players gain easier access to the fishing spots on the other side of the river.
Lunch by the lancalliums teleport is right next to multiple fishing spots and requires completion of The Depths of Despair quest to use. This location rivals Shilo Village if one has access to a good bank teleport such as the Crafting cape teleport. 
South-east of the Farming Guild.
North of the Chaos Druid Tower near East Ardougne.
Barbarian Village has a permanent fire nearby where players can cook and drop the fish.

The experience rates shown in the table below assume not wearing the angler's outfit. The AFK rates include the time spent dropping the fish, and the actual rates vary depending on how fast the fish are dropped. Using the spots south-east of Prifddinas will result in about 10% faster experience per hour.

 level XP/h (AFK) XP/h (3-tick) 20 13,000 23,000 30 25,000 45,000 40 30,000 53,000 50 34,000 61,000 60 37,000 68,000 70 41,000 75,000 80 44,000 81,000 90 47,000 87,000 99 50,000 93,000

Levels 47–99: Drift net fishing

Drift net fishing is the most efficient way to train both Fishing and Hunter at the same time. However, it is not the fastest way to train Fishing on its own due to the split rates. The method offers higher Hunter experience rates than Fishing, so once Hunter no longer needs to be trained, switch to a method that offers faster Fishing experience.

Drift net fishing requires level 47 Fishing and level 44 Hunter (both unboostable), and completion of Bone Voyage to access Fossil Island underwater. For optimal rates, players will also need to wear a fishbowl helmet and a diving apparatus obtained from the Pirate Pete subquest of Recipe for Disaster, as well as flippers obtained from mogres. Wearing a merfolk trident, a trident of the seas, a trident of the swamp, or a dragon harpoon will increase the chance of successfully chasing the fish shoal into the nets. In addition, stamina potions (or some other form of run energy restoration) are needed for the fastest rates.

To do this method, speak to Ceto to enter the fishing area located in the northern part of the Fossil Island underwater. This costs 200 numulites per day, or 20,000 numulites for permanent access. Set up drift nets on the drift net anchors and click the fish shoals once to chase them into the nets. Prioritise fish shoals nearer to the drift nets. The nets will become full after 10 fish shoals caught, after which the player will need to set the drift nets up again. Players can store up to 2,000 drift nets at Annette by bringing her the nets in banknotes.

Players can optionally bank the fish caught for 5 numulites per full net. This will lower experience rates slightly, but will also offset the money spent on drift nets. The quality of fish obtained scales with the Fishing level, with raw lobsters starting to be caught at level 50. 

The experience rates in the table below assume 1,150 fish shoal caught per hour. The experience per fish shoal scales until level 70 Fishing and Hunter, where 77 Fishing experience and 101.5 Hunter experience are gained per fish shoal. Expect slightly lower rates if banking the fish. With good practice, it is possible to catch up to 1,200–1,250 fish shoal per hour. Buying the drift nets on the Grand Exchange would cost  per hour.

From level 44 to 99 Hunter, the player will gain 9,842,153 Fishing experience if starting at level 47 Fishing. This would require 12,944 drift nets, which would cost .

Levels 58–71/99: Barbarian Fishing

thumb|3-tick Barbarian Fishing using the cut-eat method.
3-tick Barbarian Fishing becomes one of the fastest training methods at level 58. This method offers small amounts of passive Agility and Strength experience, which makes it an efficient way to train Fishing for players with low Agility and Strength levels.

Even though Barbarian Fishing becomes available at level 48, it is faster to do drift net fishing or 3-tick fly fishing until level 58, after which the player can catch leaping salmon. Without tick manipulation Barbarian Fishing is only recommended as a low-effort alternative that offers decent experience rates.

Players must complete a portion of Barbarian Training to be able to catch leaping fish. Having level 30 Agility and Strength is required for catching leaping salmon, and level 45 in both for leaping sturgeon. Players will also need suitable bait such as feathers and a barbarian rod obtained from Otto's Grotto. For tick manipulation players will also need certain items to create a 3-tick action, such as herb and tar or knife and teak/mahogany logs, and a knife should the player cut the fish.

The best spot for Barbarian Fishing is at the pond next to the Otto's Grotto. Players can quickly get there by using a games necklace or Grouping teleport to Barbarian Assault and running south-west.  There is also a spot on Mount Quidamortem which is popular for a slightly less active version utilising the Fish Barrel and banking at Chambers of Xeric bank chest to allow players not to have to actively drop fish as this is too active for some.

The basic method for 3-tick fishing is to drop the fish between catches. To do so, start the 3-tick cycle, drop the fish using shift drop, and click on the fishing spot. This requires accurate clicking and some practice to perform consistently, but it is more efficient than dropping a full inventory.

"Cut-eat" or "eat-cut" fishing (depending on the order) is a more advanced and slightly more click-intensive method. Having at least level 80 Cooking is recommended for a 100% cut rate for leaping salmon and sturgeon. Cut-eat fishing is done by starting a 3-tick cycle with herb and tar, cutting the fish with a knife and eating the roe/caviar to tick manipulate. When you run out of roe/caviar to be eaten and fish to be cut, use herb and tar to continue the 3-tick cycle. The benefits of this method is that it provides some passive Cooking experience, it does not require players to drop fish (therefore Shift is unused), and it is slightly cheaper due to fish offcuts also being produced which are used as bait over feathers. However, it is less predictable due to randomness being involved, which may take time getting used to. It is also stricter with timing; if the cutting and eating is done too late, the cycle becomes offset.

The experience rates in the table below assume the player is not wearing the angler's outfit. The AFK rates include the time spent dropping the fish, and the actual rates vary depending on how fast the fish are dropped. The Cooking rates from using the cut-eat method assumes level 99 Cooking; having level 80 Cooking would lower the rate by roughly 1,000 Cooking experience per hour.

Levels 71–99: 2-tick harpooning swordfish/tuna

thumb|2-tick harpooning on the shores of Piscarilius
2-tick harpooning swordfish and tuna offers the fastest Fishing experience. Lure two rats west of the Port Piscarilius bank so that they attack the player every two ticks. Equip a shortbow without ammo and turn on Auto Retaliate. Click the fishing spot on the same tick that a hitsplat appears. When done correctly, the player has a chance of catching fish every two ticks instead of five.

Alternatively, 2-tick harpoon in the Fishing Guild on a PvP world. Instead of rats, have another account attack the player with darts. This offers around 5% faster experience rates than Port Piscarilius when uninterrupted. However, the player may get attacked by player killers, which will increase the risk and lower the long-term rate closer to the Port Piscarilius rate.

Even though this method becomes available at level 35, other methods offer faster experience until level 61 due to low catch rates of the regular harpoon. The crystal harpoon is strongly recommended as it has a higher catch rate compared to the dragon or the regular harpoon. Players with low Agility or Strength levels are advised to train with Barbarian Fishing as the passive experience gained will benefit the player more than having slightly faster Fishing experience. However, 2-tick harpooning sharks is the fastest method on average of obtaining the heron pet, which can be desirable for some players. This method is not worth doing without tick manipulation, as there are better methods for those who seek fast experience or a low-effort alternative.

The experience rates in the table below assume fishing in Port Piscarilius and having good practice with the method. Expect lower rates when learning. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to 137,000 experience per hour at level 99. Players who are using the infernal harpoon can expect to gain around 20,000–26,000 passive Cooking experience per hour, depending on the Fishing level.

Other methods
Levels 35–99: Tempoross

Fighting the Tempoross offers relatively fast experience and it requires fairly low amount of effort compared to the tick manipulation methods.

Not cooking the harpoonfish means getting lower amounts of points/loot but significantly more Fishing experience. With a crystal harpoon and a Fishing level near 99, this is the fastest experience in the game if not using tick manipulation methods. With no crystal harpoon or if not near level 99 Fishing, drift net fishing will yield higher experience rates. 

  Level XP/h The standard harpoon, the barb-tail harpoon, and Barbarian Fishing all have the same experience rates.    35 30,000    70 62,000 66,000  77,000 80 65,000 69,000 71,000 85,000 90 68,000 72,000 74,000 92,000 99 70,000 74,000 76,000 95,000As of 7th August 2024, a "Solo Start" option has been added. Up to 102,000 experience per hour is possible without using another account.

Cooking the harpoonfish means lower experience rate but significantly more points and, therefore, loot. It is recommended for Ironman players and pet hunters to use the infernal harpoon when they reach the level requirements.

Levels 43–99: Aerial fishing

Aerial fishing is a viable alternative method to train both Fishing and Hunter. However, drift net fishing offers faster experience in both skills, so this method is only recommended for players who wish to obtain the unique rewards from Alry the Angler. While the angler's outfit is a possible reward from Aerial fishing, it is not recommended to get it here since it can be obtained in a much faster way through Fishing Trawler.

Aerial fishing requires level 43 Fishing and level 35 Hunter. The fastest way to reach the island in the centre of Lake Molch is to use the fairy ring , run south-west, and take the boat to the island.

Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume 1,600 fish are caught per hour. If cutting the fish, players will also get some passive Cooking experience.

Levels 65–99: Karambwan

Catching karambwan is a profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. 
This method requires completion of Tai Bwo Wannai Trio. Karambwan fishing spots do not move, which allows the player to catch an entire inventory of fish without interaction. When using the fish barrel, catching a full inventory takes around 3–5 minutes.

Karambwan are caught with a karambwan vessel and raw karambwanji. Raw karambwanji can be caught north-east of the fairy ring  using a small fishing net. The karambwan fishing spots are located just north of the fairy ring .

When banking the fish, having a quick access to a bank and fairy rings is recommended. Good direct bank teleports include the Crafting cape, Karamja gloves 3 or 4, or a ring of dueling. For fairy rings, use the quest point cape or the fairy ring in the player-owned house. If using the fairy ring in the player-owned house, players can alternatively bring a rune pouch and bank at Seers' Village (after the hard Kandarin Diary) or at the Grand Exchange (after the medium Varrock Diary). Players who do not have access to these options can use the fairy ring to travel to Zanaris or another fairy ring with close proximity to a bank such as . 

Players who have completed the elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary can equip a dragon harpoon instead of a dramen staff and use its special attack to boost their Fishing level for slightly better catch rates.

Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the fish barrel, not wearing the angler's outfit, and include banking time as well as some idle time. Expect around 10% lower rates if not using the fish barrel.
With the fish barrel, angler's outfit, 99 fishing, and efficient banking, it's possible to catch upwards of 900 karambwans per hour, gaining up to 46,000 XP per hour.

Levels 80–99: Infernal eel

Catching infernal eels in the inner part of Mor Ul Rek is a profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. To gain access to the area, the player must show a fire cape to a TzHaar-Ket guard (this does not consume the cape). Infernal eels are caught with an oily fishing rod and fishing bait while having ice gloves equipped. Smash the eels with a hammer to obtain Tokkul, onyx bolt tips, or lava scale shards. Use the spot in the south-easternmost area of the city, as the other two areas may have their fishing spots disappear more often.

Experience and profit rates are shown in the table below. The profit rates assume not wearing a Rada's blessing. The profit made from Tokkul assumes buying an uncut onyx with Karamja gloves equipped.

Levels 82–99: Minnows

right|250px
Catching minnows offers relatively slow experience, but it can provide decent profit depending on the Grand Exchange price of raw sharks. This can be done at Kylie Minnow's fishing platform in the Fishing Guild, which requires level 82 Fishing, a small fishing net, completion of the quest Fishing Contest, and having full angler's outfit to access. Minnows can be exchanged for noted raw sharks, which can be sold for profit.

Minnow fishing spots move clockwise every 15 seconds. In addition, a fishing spot will occasionally spawn flying fish instead of providing minnows; flying fish will eat 20 minnow directly from the player's inventory as long as they keep fishing there, forcing them to move to another spot. A flying fish will only appear after a fishing spot has changed and will continue to eat the player's minnows until the fishing spot changes position once again. 

Experience and profit rates are shown in the table below. Wearing a Rada's blessing is recommended for extra profit, as it increases minnows per hour by 2% per tier of diary completed.

Levels 82–99: Anglerfish

At level 82 Fishing, you can start catching anglerfish in Port Piscarilius. In order to catch anglerfish, Sandworms are required. Sandworms can be purchased from Tynan's Fishing Supplies nearby or the Grand Exchange.

Players can gain around 15,000 experience per hour at level 82, and 23,000 experience per hour at level 99. If diabolic worms are used this improves to around 30,000 experience per hour at level 82, and 39,000 experience per hour at level 99.

Levels 85–99: Dark crabs

Catching dark crabs inside the Resource Area becomes a viable low-effort option after completing the elite Wilderness Diary. The diary reward increases the catch rate for dark crabs significantly and provides the player free access to the Resource Area. The fishing spots inside the Resource Area also never move, which makes this method a very low-effort option. However, as the Resource Area is located in deep Wilderness, the player will encounter player killers.

The fish can be noted at Piles for 50 coins each. It is advised to bank the fish in Edgeville every so often to reduce the risk. To have a good chance of escaping player killers, wear cheap defensive gear while 3- or 4-iteming expensive armour pieces, and bring a few Saradomin brews food along with super restores. Players can optionally bring a lockpick and escape using the nearby magic axe hut. Equipping an imbued ring of wealth increases the chance of obtaining clue bottles. If the fish barrel is a protected item on death the dark crabs inside the fish barrel are retained upon death to a player killer.

Players who do not care about profit can simply drop the fish and risk nothing. Having spare Wilderness swords and the Edgeville respawn is recommended if doing this, as the player can expect to eventually die to a player killer. 

Players can gain around 40,000 experience per hour.

Levels 87–99: Sacred eel

At level 87 and after partially completing Regicide, catching sacred eels at Zul-Andra becomes a profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. Sacred eels are caught with a fishing rod and fishing bait. Dissect the eels with a knife to extract Zulrah's scales. Doing so requires at least level 72 Cooking. The Zulrah's scales obtained, and Cooking experience gained, scale with your Cooking level.

Experience and profit rates are shown in the table below. The expected profit rates assume not wearing a Rada's blessing.

===== Free-to-play Fishing training =====
There are several ways to train Fishing in free-to-play. Depending on the desired goals of the player, they can choose between methods favouring experience rates or profit. If you choose to go with making a profit, be sure to sell your catch at the Grand Exchange and not a General store in order to maximize your profits. Keep in mind, since the Grand Exchange acts as an in-game stock market, that means the prices are always changing. You can find the latest prices on the Grand Exchange here.

Methods with the highest experience rates
Levels 1–20 – Raw shrimps and raw anchovies
  Fishing raw shrimps and raw anchovies with a small fishing net at a net fishing location is the fastest way to train fishing until level 20 with experience rates of 1,500–3,000 experience per hour. The small net fishing spot is the only possible fishing location at level 1. Players must reach level 15 Fishing before there is a chance for them to receive a raw anchovy while fishing, which will increase their experience rates to around 7,500 experience per hour. To achieve the most optimal experience rates, players would want to drop the caught fish, instead of banking. Alternatively, the raw fish can be cooked for small amounts of Cooking experience. If planning on banking the fish, players should fish at Al Kharid, due to its proximity to a bank, however there is an aggressive level 14 scorpion that occasionally wanders near the southern fishing spots. Another spot to bank the fish is south of the bank in Draynor Village, next to the willow trees, though beware of aggressive level 7 Dark Wizards. For players that don't want to have to deal with combat, and want to sell the fish, the fishing spot South-West of Port Sarim is ideal as it is a somewhat short run away from Gerrant's Fishy Business.

Alternative for levels 5–20 – raw sardines and raw herring
  Fishing raw sardine and raw herring with a fishing rod and bait at a bait fishing location is the fastest way to train fishing until level 20 with experience rate of 3,000-8,000 experience per hour (when herring is unlocked it is 8,000). The small net fishing spot is the ideal place to fish. Players who reach level 20 fishing can move to fishing trout for faster experience per hour.

Levels 20–40/99 – Raw trout and raw salmon
  Fishing raw trout and raw salmon with a fly fishing rod at a fly fishing location and dropping it offers the fastest way to train Fishing to 99 as a free-to-play. At level 20, players can expect to achieve around ~15k Fishing XP/hour while dropfishing. Players must reach level 30 Fishing before there is a chance for them to receive a raw salmon while fishing, which will increase their experience rates to ~33k Fishing XP/hour while dropfishing at higher Fishing levels. Fly fishing can be done in Lumbridge, and Barbarian Village, and consumes a feather per every fish caught. Around 600 feathers would be consumed from levels 20–40, and 225,000 feathers from 20–99.

At the expense of experience per hour, players can cook their raw fish on the permanent fire in Barbarian Village next to the fishing spot, providing them with Cooking experience and a food source if players choose to bank the cooked fish.

 Method #1: Fly fish at Barbarian Village, cook at Barbarian Village permanent fire, bank cooked fish at Ferox Enclave (57 Woodcutting needed for waka canoe, canoe from Barbarian Village to Ferox Enclave for banking, and canoe back to Barbarian Village to fish): ~18 k Fishing XP/hour & ~24 k Cooking XP/hour

 Method #2: Fly fish at Barbarian Village, bank raw fish at Ferox Enclave (57 Woodcutting needed for waka canoe, canoe from Barbarian Village to Ferox Enclave for banking, and canoe back to Barbarian Village to fish): ~26 k Fishing XP/hour

 Method #3: Fly fish at Barbarian Village, cook at Barbarian Village permanent fire, drop cooked fish: ~23.5 k Fishing XP/hour & ~31 k Cooking XP/hour.

Alternatively, players can bring an axe and tinderbox to Lumbridge, chop some logs near the fishing spot and make a fire at the fishing spot. They can use the fire to cook the fish directly after catching them (and then click the spot to continue fishing). The cooked fish could be used for tick manipulation by eating them, resulting in significantly higher experience rates (~80k Fishing XP/hour) at the cost of increased intensity.

For the full guide on catching lobsters, see here.

 Fish raw lobsters at Musa Point. Players can expect to make  and 12,600 Fishing experience per hour. To bank the caught raw lobsters, use the boat to travel to Port Sarim, costing 30 coins  one way. In Port Sarim, walk to the docks with the monks and use the bank deposit to deposit the raw lobsters. If you have completed both The Corsair Curse and Dragon Slayer I, you can also use the Corsair Cove Resource Area to avoid paying the fare back and forth to use the deposit box.

Levels 50–99 – Raw tuna/swordfish 
For the full guide on catching tuna/swordfish, see here.

 Fish at the harpoon spot at Musa Point. Players can expect to make  and 17,160 Fishing experience per hour.

Alternatives:

 More clicks: Drop the raw swordfish ( each), since they are worth a lot less than raw tuna ( each).
 Less walking and coins, more experience per hour: Sell fish at the Karamja General Store.
 More total experience and clicks, less walking and coins: Cook the fish after caught.
 An axe can be wielded to save an inventory slot.
Logs can be obtained from trees near the charter ship.
 A tinderbox can be brought or purchased at the Karamja General Store for 1 coin.
Depending on the amount, trading burnt fish at the Karamja General Store (0 coins) can be quicker than dropping them one at a time.

Other methods
Levels 7/20/33–99 – Ruins of Camdozaal
After the completion of Below Ice Mountain, players can fish in the Ruins of Camdozaal. This is generally slower to train Fishing than fishing for trout and salmon (even when dropping Camdozaal fish) but this method will also help train both Cooking and Prayer. In other words, this training method is only recommended if you plan on training Prayer.

It requires 7 Fishing and 7 Cooking to fish and prepare guppy.  Having 33 Fishing and 33 Cooking are needed to fish and prepare tetra, which provide the most prayer experience among the free-to-play fish. Tetra stop ruining at Cooking level 61. However, players can stop ruining tetra around level 54 Cooking if they purchase the Preparation buff from Ramarno's Shard Exchange for 2500 Barronite shards. Purchasing the Fishing and Preparation buffs from Ramarno's shard exchange slightly increases the experience rates for lower Fishing and Cooking levels respectively.
Use a small fishing net to catch fish in the fishing spot nearby. A small fishing net is provided in the space north of the preparation table and altar.
Prepare these fish at the preparation table using a knife. You'll gain Cooking experience. A knife lies on the floor nearby the table.
Offer the prepared fish at the altar for Prayer experience.
Experience rates per hour are 5,600 Fishing, 7,400 Cooking, and 2,400 Prayer or less when offering all fish types (only possible at Level 61+ cooking, when tetra stop ruining) with decent efficiency.

===== Pay-to-play Cooking training =====
This guide aims to assist players in training Cooking by using the most effective methods available. The Grand Exchange prices of items will fluctuate, so check the prices before buying and selling supplies in large quantities.

Fastest experience
Levels 1–30: Poison karambwan
From level 1 to 30, 1-tick cook raw karambwan into poison karambwan. Karambwan can be cooked without tick delay by holding down 1 and rapidly using raw karambwan on a fire or range. This method costs money, but the overall loss will be relatively small as reaching level 30 would take less than ten minutes.

Note that cooking poison karambwan does not have any requirements, unlike cooked karambwan.

168 successfully cooked poison karambwan are required to reach level 30. Players are advised to buy at least 500 raw karambwan, as the burn rate is high at lower levels. Assuming all 500 raw karambwan are used to reach level 30, this would result in a loss of . If the player is not going to use tick manipulation, it is recommended to cook other fish (see below) as this is cheaper and it would offer similar experience rates.

Levels 1–30: Cooking fish
Alternatively, cook various fish for early experience. This is slower than cooking poison karambwan, but cheaper and less click-intensive.

The fish needed for each level range are shown in the table below. Buy roughly 2.5 times more raw fish than the amount of successfully cooked fish needed, as the burn rate is fairly high at lower levels.

Levels 30–99: Cooked karambwan
Completion of the quest Tai Bwo Wannai Trio is required to successfully cook karambwan.

thumb|1-tick cooking karambwan.
1-tick cooking karambwan provides the fastest Cooking experience. Karambwan can be cooked without tick delay by holding down 1 or space and rapidly using raw karambwan on a fire or range. This requires a lot of click accuracy and can be difficult to do consistently for long periods of time. Without tick manipulation this method offers much lower experience rates and is only recommended as a cheap low-effort alternative.

Using one of the cooking locations right next to a bank offers the fastest experience rates for 1-ticking karambwan. These are located in Rogues' Den, Myths' Guild, and in the inner part of Mor Ul Rek. The Hosidius kitchen is not recommended for 1-ticking due to the increased distance to the bank, which will result in around 10–20% lower experience rates and make mistakes much more likely. Cooking gauntlets do not affect the burn rate for karambwan.

Without tick manipulation the Hosidius kitchen is the best option up to level 96. The lower burn rate outweighs the faster cooking rate of Rogues' Den when not using tick manipulation, since the longer banking time will have less effect on experience rates at a lower cooking speed compared to 1-ticking. Completing the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary at level 79 is recommended for further decreased burn rates. At level 96, use one of the cooking locations right next to a bank for faster experience rates.

The experience rates for 1-ticking assume using the Rogues' Den fire and cooking 5,000 karambwan per hour. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to cook up to 5,470 karambwan per hour. The AFK rates assume cooking 1,385 karambwan per hour at the Hosidius kitchen up to level 96 and 1,435 karambwan per hour in the Rogues' Den afterwards.

Levels 10–99: Bake Pie
Completion of the quest Lunar Diplomacy is required to cast Bake Pie.

Baking pies using the Bake Pie spell offers relatively fast experience at a low amount of effort. It also offers a decent amount of passive Magic experience, which can be useful for some players. This method can be fairly expensive due to the low supply of uncooked pies, and some options may not be viable due to low trading volumes.

Compared to cooking pies on a range, Bake Pie is cast at a rate of once per 3 ticks instead of the usual 4 ticks, yielding 33.33% faster cooking speeds. An inventory of 27 pies takes 81 ticks (48.6 seconds) to cook. Additionally, the pies never burn.

The experience rates in the table below assume players bake 1,885 pies per hour, which would also give 113,100 passive Magic experience per hour. The costs assume the player is wearing a steam battlestaff or other items that give unlimited water and fire runes, such as a Tome of Fire.

Levels 35/68–99: Jug of wine
Making jugs of wine offers relatively fast experience. This method costs money, but it is usually fairly cheap depending on the Grand Exchange prices. It requires more attention than cooking fish or casting Bake Pie, however.

Jugs of wine are made by combining grapes with jugs of water to make unfermented wines, and after 12 seconds they will ferment into jugs of wine. Wines ferment in the bank, so players do not have to wait for the wines to ferment in the inventory. The 12-second timer resets each time the player makes a new jug of unfermented wine, whether banked or in the inventory, which means a large stack of wine in the bank can ferment all at once. Successfully making each jug of wine grants 200 experience.

Grapes are added to jugs of water at a rate of once per 2 ticks, which is double the rate most items are cooked on a range or fire. This, combined with the high 200 experience per jug of wine, is why wine has such fast experience rates. However, with only 14 produced per inventory, making jugs of wine requires more attention than most other cooking items, as one inventory of ingredients can be combined every 16.8 seconds, compared to the 67.2 seconds it takes to cook an entire inventory.

Players can gain up to 490,000 experience per hour from level 68 onwards. Below level 68, there is a chance for a jug of bad wine to be produced for 0 experience. Players using this method below level 68 should only make enough wines to get to their next cooking level to be as efficient as possible due to the chances of successfully creating wines increasing with every level gained.

Levels 30–99: Cooking fish
Cooking various fish is a cheap or profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. Cooking an inventory of fish takes around 1 minute and 14 seconds in the Hosidius Kitchen, including banking.

The cooking gauntlets from the Family Crest quest reduce the burn rate for lobsters, swordfish, monkfish, sharks, and anglerfish when worn. Having the gauntlets is required for optimal rates when cooking these fish. Expect much lower rates without the gauntlets.

Completing the easy Kourend & Kebos Diary grants access to the cooking ranges in the Hosidius Kitchen. They provide a 5% increased chance of successfully cooking food over standard cooking ranges. This is increased to 10% after completing the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary, which requires level 84 Cooking (boostable). Cooking fish in the Hosidius Kitchen offers comparable or slightly higher experience rates than at the ranges in Myths' Guild or Mor Ul Rek because of the increased cooked rate, despite the ranges being slightly further away from a bank. The Hosidius ranges remain comparable or better until level 93, after which it becomes faster to cook anglerfish on a normal range.

The fish and experience needed for each level range are shown in the table below. The experience rates assume 1,365 fish cooked per hour in the Hosidius Kitchen, or 1,435 fish cooked per hour in Myths' Guild or Mor Ul Rek. The rates assume wearing the cooking gauntlets (where applicable) and using the Hosidius kitchen unless noted otherwise. Cooking in the Hosidius kitchens assumes completion of the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary from level 79 Cooking onwards (with a +5 boost to level 84). Experience and profit rates take the burn rates into account. The actual amounts of raw fish needed can vary depending on luck, so slightly more or less fish may be needed. Swordfish and monkfish offer very similar rates for levels 68–80, so choose whichever is more profitable.

Choosing Cooking locations
Cooking most foods takes four game ticks, and 28 can be cooked per inventory. Therefore, a full inventory takes 112 ticks or 67.2 seconds, making Cooking one of the least attentive skills in the game.

Assuming no banking and no food burned, a player could theoretically cook up to 1,500 raw foods per hour; however, factoring in bank-time, players can expect to cook between 1,300 and 1,400. The following table compares the different cooking locations by their bank proximity and corresponding items cooked per hour. The table assumes the bank distance is ran, no food is burnt, and that banking takes 3 seconds (5 ticks).

Close to the Lumbridge Teleport spell location.
*Running takes 0.5 ticks per square. A bank 4 tiles away will require you to traverse 8 tiles (there and back), so crossing 8 tiles at 2 tiles per tick will take 4 ticks.

 Calculating exact times 
To find the exact number of ticks to cook one inventory at any given location, players can first use the formula 117+(tiles), where 117 refers to the minimum ticks taken to cook and bank, and (tiles) refers to the number of tiles the cooking source is from the bank. If run is enabled, divide (tiles) by 2 and round up. Players can translate this into seconds by multiplying it by , the number of seconds per tick.

Players can then find out how many items they can cook in an hour by taking the number of ticks and putting it into the formula (3600/(x))*28. Here, 3600 refers to the number of seconds in an hour, x refers to the number of seconds it takes to do one inventory, and 28 refers to the number of inventory spaces the player has. Players should round down to the nearest whole number.

Cooking level table
This is a cropped table indicating what can be achieved starting at certain levels. It only covers items efficient for training Cooking.

Minimum levelFoodExperienceNotes1Shrimps, Meat, Chicken. Anchovies30,

40,

30,

30All these items are easily obtainable by fishing or killing beginner monsters. You can also pick up meat dropped by cows in the cow field in Lumbridge where many people train and leave meat lying around. Also, when you kill chickens for their meat, always pick up the feathers dropped by them.15Trout70Trout can be multi purposed. They can serve as mid level food, or as power levelling items for both Fishing and Cooking. You can also pick up trout from many power-fishers at the river near Barbarian Village. Power-cooking trout is a popular way of levelling Cooking in free-to-play.20Pike80Pike are generally harder to fish, expensive, and yield a low amount of experience.25Salmon90Salmon can be used for mid level food and are mainly obtained by fly fishing above level 30 Fishing or you can pick them up at the barbarian village where power fishers drop them.30Apple pie130Apple pie can be made as mid level food. However, 32 Cooking is needed to enter the Cooks' Guild to make these pies in bulk.30Tuna100Tuna can be used as mid-level food. They are very popular for training Cooking since power-fishers (mostly at Musa Point) often drop them ready to be picked up and cooked, creating a free source to train Cooking quickly. Cooked tuna also has a constant demand, sometimes higher than its raw counterpart.32Cooks' GuildN/AThe Cooks' Guild is a good place to train Cooking by making jugs of wine and apple pies, as it provides materials sufficient to make them.35Pizza143Cooked pizza can be used as food. They should not be sold, but kept for adding toppings later on.35Jug of wine200Jugs of wine are the fastest Cooking experience in the game for both F2P and members for power-levelling and are commonly used for Cooking training. Wine heals 11 hitpoints, but decreases the Attack stat when drunk, limiting their use to Ranged/Magic combat and other dangerous non-combat activities. Because of these reasons together, wine is the cheapest food in the game. You may enter the Cooks' Guild to make free wine, since there are jugs, grapes, and water.40Lobster120Lobsters can be cooked as mid-high level food. Cooked lobster can sometimes be sold for more than its raw counterpart.45Swordfish140Swordfish can be cooked as mid-high level food, giving the highest healing rate for free players in a single bite. As with all fish it is consumed in one bite.45Meat pizza(143+25)Meat pizzas can be made merely by adding cooked meat on plain pizza. Raw meat is easily obtainable from killing giant rats, cows, and bears.55Anchovy pizza(143+39)Anchovy pizzas are made merely by adding cooked anchovies to plain pizza, making it heal the most in F2P worlds. It is sometimes possible to make a profit by mass buying plain cooked pizzas from Grand Exchange, adding anchovies onto them, and then selling them back them via the Grand Exchange.

Training methods
Below are some training methods suitable for different kinds of players. You should start off by doing the quest Cook's Assistant, as this will get you to level 4.

Training alongside Fishing
This method is suitable for players wanting to train Cooking along with Fishing. If the player has at least 30 Cooking, 35 Fishing and has done Dragon Slayer I, they may want to choose the Corsair Cove Resource Area as a substitute place for training rather than at Karamja.

Level 1
Shrimp can be caught without any requirements. They yield 30 experience per successful cooking. Cooked shrimps can be sold in the Grand Exchange for little profit however, they should only be used for food. The best place to net shrimps is Draynor.

Level 20
Trout can be caught in Barbarian Village or in Lumbridge, provided you have level 20 Fishing. Trout are very handy and each of them give 70 experience. Power-cookers can even grab dropped raw trout from powerfishers and cook them. If you go to Barbarian Village on a populated world, there are usually people giving away free raw trout and salmon.

Level 30
Tuna can be caught at Musa Point in Karamja by harpooning them at level 35 Fishing. Tuna yields 100 experience each successful cook, though the catching speed is slow. The dropped raw tunas from powerfishers can be taken to cook. If a player decides to use this method to train Cooking, a very busy world should be selected. There is no permanent cooking location so bring an axe and tinderbox to use on the trees by the dock.

Level 40
Lobsters can be caught at Musa Point in Karamja at level 40 Fishing. Lobster yields 120 experience each cooking and catching speed is comparable to harpooning. There are rarely any lobster drops from powerfishers, thus fishing them yourself is better.

Level 45/50
Swordfish can be caught in Musa Point in Karamja once level 50 Fishing is attained. Swordfish yields 140 experience each cooking. However, swordfish catching speed is the slowest among all free-to-play fish, because tuna are also caught while harpooning. While swordfish can be cooked starting at level 45, a higher Cooking level is recommended before starting to cook swordfish, as the chances of successfully cooking them are relatively low at lower Cooking levels.

Alternate method to level without burning food
This is an alternate method to level Cooking without burning fish, using the highest-level food possible such that they cannot be burned; however, it will most likely be slower than the method suggested above. It is recommended to use the other methods to attain level 50 Cooking before beginning.

FishStartlevelEndlevelNumberof fishPrice ofuncooked fishPrice ofcooked fishProfit/Loss(overall)Price peruncooked fishPrice percooked fishProfit/Lossper fish50585864647474868699Totals

Another method is to cook pizza from the level you're able to cook them all the way to 99. It is better experience than swordfish (143 vs 140), however, 3 steps are required to make them, making the hourly experience rate lower than swordfish. The prices change constantly, so check the prices before selling the pizzas.

Training in the Cooks' Guild
Please note, 32 Cooking is needed to enter the Cooks' Guild. You cannot enter the guild without getting a chef's hat.

Level 32
Although apple pies can be made at level 30 Cooking, only the Cooks' Guild has free and fairly abundant resources for mass-producing them. One jug, pot, pie dish and three cooking apple spawns are available in the guild. The process of making pies can be sped up if players bring their own jugs and pots prior. Wheat can be harvested in the field directly behind the guild, then made into flour using the mill. Collecting flour, water and mixing pastry dough can all be done on the , then cooked using the ranges on the , while obtaining more equipment from the .

Level 35
Jugs and grapes can also be found inside the guild. Wine can be fermented within the guild by filling jugs with water from the sink on the ground floor, then using grapes on the jugs of water. Wine gives the highest Cooking experience per success, though grape spawning is slow. Nothing is needed to be brought prior. This method of training is somewhat expensive, but can give up to 2,800 experience per inventory (14 grapes/14 jugs of water).

Training with complex food
Complex food requires time to make and can initially be a bit costly, but can be very rewarding. Complex food basically has varied trips, ranging from Draynor to Wilderness. It is possible to power-level these kinds of food, simply by purchasing the final uncooked version of the food (an uncooked pie, for example) from the Grand Exchange, or trading with another player. This method is usually quite expensive, but in turn offers very fast experience.

Level 10
Redberry pies are the first complex food that can be made. As these pies serve no purpose at higher levels, a quick method shall be shown here. The supplies such as buckets or jugs can be bought from a general store, but it's best to obtain the berries from the bushes south-east of Varrock, straight north from the entrance to Al Kharid. After that, redberry pies can be made in bulk. This pie is one of the easiest to make due to the low level requirement, and often the most expensive one to sell in the Grand Exchange, possibly due to its quest use. Using the Cooks' Guild and bushes located on the outskirts of Varrock, a decent profit can be made, however the experience given is low compared to other cooking processes.

Level 20
Meat pies can be similarly to redberry pies, and a variety of different uncooked meats may be cooked into cooked meat. Raw beef is more efficient so you should kill cows and bank the raw beef.

Level 25
Stews can be made by picking potatoes in the potato field between Lumbridge and Varrock (directly north of the Lumbridge cow farm) and killing the cows for raw beef. Bowls can be taken from the kitchen of Lumbridge Castle, purchased from general stores or the Grand Exchange, or manufactured with the Crafting skill (requires level 8 Crafting).

Level 35
Plain pizza can be made from one tomato, one cheese and one pizza base; the pizza base can be made by using a pot of flour with a jug of water or bought from Fat Tony in the Bandit Camp (Wilderness) for 4 coins each. To ensure quick buying of pizza bases, exactly 51 coins can be brought to buy exactly 10 pizza bases and 145 coins to buy 28 pizza bases, and immediately move to and from the bank. Due to the personal shop update, the respawn rate of shop supply is low and players might choose to make the pizza bases themselves or wait. Cheese and tomatoes can be taken from Aggie's house or Fat Tony's camp, but both of them have disadvantages. Draynor lacks a support of cooking ranges, and Fat Tony is in the Wilderness which means players are at risk of being attacked by other players. Bandits are also aggressive, meaning that lower-levelled players must take care if they choose to train with pizzas in the Wilderness. Cooking pizzas at the range in Al Kharid can earn up to 180,000 experience per hour.

Level 55
Anchovy pizza can be made. Making an anchovy pizza out of plain pizza and anchovies is always a success. Raw anchovies can be fished south of Lumbridge, in Al Kharid and in Draynor.

Making jugs of wine
Jugs of wine can be made starting at 35 cooking, providing the fastest Cooking experience in the game for free-to-play, topping out at 470,000–490,000 experience per hour at level 68. Wine is not created at a range or fire; instead, players can combine a bundle of grapes with a jug of water in their inventory, creating an unfermented wine. After 12 seconds, the unfermented wine ferments into a jug of wine, granting 200 experience. If a new unfermented wine is made before the 12 seconds are up, the timer will reset back to 12 seconds, so experience for all the wine will be awarded at once 12 seconds after completely stopping the process of making wine. Before level 68 Cooking, there is also a chance to create a jug of bad wine instead depending on level, granting no experience.

62,147 jugs of wine are required to go from 68 to 99 Cooking. Jugs of water and grapes can be bought en masse from the Grand Exchange and combined together at any bank.

Total Jugs of water/Grapes neededPrice of Jugs of waterPrice of GrapesTotal CostPrice per Jugs of waterPrice per GrapesCost per Wine62,147

Profitability
Players wishing to know the profits of cooking certain foods should consult the related calculators, such as Calculator:Cooking/Fish for profits from fish, and Cooking/Burn level to see what level different foods stop being burned.

Fish, particularly the high level ones, play a big role in the cooking market. They make up the bulk of the food market, with high demands for both raw and cooked forms. Note that buying fish raw from the Grand Exchange and selling the cooked product in the Grand Exchange is not always profitable due to many players buying mass amounts of fish to get to 99 Cooking. For many fish there is often a price difference between cooked and raw fish.

A way to train Cooking and gain a profit would be to make foods containing many steps. These foods give much more experience than fish when made from scratch, many cannot be burnt, and can be sold for modest profit in the Grand Exchange. The downside to this method is that it takes much longer to prepare the ingredients for combining.

Training locations
Some places are more suited for cooking than others. Here are some recommended places.

LocationDistance from range/fireOptimal foodNotesGrand ExchangeImmediate Power levellingThe Grand Exchange is one of the only banks in Gielinor that allows you to make fires one tile away from the bank clerk. This makes it the fastest place to cook food that can be cooked on a fire in free-to-play (i.e. fish). Grab 26 fish, a tinderbox, and a log you can burn, then step one tile away from the bank clerk and light a fire, then cook at it. This requires you to have one log to burn for every 26 fish you want to cook, but provides bonus Firemaking experience at no cost to your Cooking experience speed. Make sure to use the banks on the east side of the Grand Exchange, so that after lighting your fire you walk back directly in front of the bank clerk without any delay from walking. Alternatively, players often train Firemaking at the Grand Exchange, so you can use other player's fires instead, though they may go out in the middle of cooking or be further from the bank clerk. This is also the most convenient area to power level with jugs of wine, as they can be bought en masse from the clerk.Falador PVP bankVery shortPower levellingThis is the closest bank to a range in F2P. On the PVP world, a bank is added to White Knights' Castle in Falador, which is very close to the ranges within the castle. Even with 1 Agility, you will never run out of run energy training here, making it one of the fastest and most profitable places to train (because you will not need to use energy potions to keep running).

Be very careful not to take anything valuable out of the safe zone in White Knights' Castle (for example when taking a trip to the Grand Exchange to buy more raw fish), as other players can Snare and kill you almost anywhere on PVP worlds. Dying while cooking however is only a minor inconvenience, as all you will lose is some time to teleport/walk back and a single inventory of food. There are no nearby fishing spots.Draynor VillageVery shortShrimp and Anchovies or Power levellingWith the Forestry update a persistent fire was added in front of the Friendly Forester making this one of the fastest fires in F2P at 17 tiles away and 1 click to and from the fire or bank.
The nearest range is in Draynor Manor

You can cook on the fireplace inside Ned's house. The fireplace has the same burn rate as a regular fire, not a range. The fireplace can cook any meat, fish, or seafood.Lumbridge bankVery shortLured, nettedThe logs which respawn next to the bank on the roof of Lumbridge castle are a very fast place to cook. Just take out 27 fish at a time with a tinderbox and light one of the two logs against the western side of the roof, alternating between them, and cook your fish at it. This also saves an inventory spot since you don't have to take out your own logs from the bank, allowing you to cook one extra fish compared to simply lighting your own fire.

There is also a special range in the kitchen on the  of Lumbridge castle which requires finishing Cook's Assistant to access. Cooking here has a lower chance of burning certain foods than cooking on a normal range or fire.Al Kharid bankVery shortPower levellingThis bank is second closest to a range among everywhere in F2P worlds (closest that isn't on a PVP world), and has no doors or anything that could block you, which can reduce time taken to cook an inventory. However, depending on your Agility level, you may slowly lose run energy training here and eventually have to walk instead of sprinting. The only fishing spots nearby are basic small net/bait spots.Edgeville bankVery shortLured fishThere is a range right by the bank in Doris's house. (However, Doris is a members-only NPC, so the house is empty.) It is also a popular place to train Firemaking, which means that there will be plenty of fires around to cook on if the player wishes for faster runs. (Note: the house that contains the range has a door that automatically closes occasionally.)Varrock east bankVery shortPower levellingThe eastern Varrock bank has a cooking range located just to the south-west. The house is empty and the bank is within clicking distance making trips very fast.Varrock west bankVery shortPower levellingThere are two ranges located outside the west walls of Varrock. One at the main level of Juliet's house, and the alternate would be at Gertrude's house. The closest fishing area is Barbarian Village which is rather far from the cooking area. It is advised to have raw food prepared in the bank. The advantages of this cooking area is the relatively short distance to the Grand Exchange, as well as access to Varrock's west bank.Barbarian Village fishing spotsVery shortLured fishPlayers can catch trout/salmon or pick up dropped trout and salmon commonly dropped by other players and use the permanent fire located right at the fishing spots to cook the fish.Corsair Cove Resource AreaShort (permanent campfire)Tuna, lobsters and swordfishRequires completion of Dragon Slayer I. There is a permanent campfire south of the area, where Lord Marshal Brogan and Altarkiz are. Players will usually also provide fires by burning the logs they have cut from the trees. If players are looking to bank their food, they need to keep in mind that The Corsair Curse has to be completed in order to use the bank a distance away. Players are advised to keep run mode on when travelling to the bank.Musa Point spotVery longTuna, lobsters and swordfishMusa spot is the most popular place for free players to catch tuna, lobsters, and swordfish, which is a major source of Cooking experience. Fire must be manually made by cutting logs (at the entrance to the Musa Point) and lit with a tinderbox, or other players might do it instead. In busy worlds, fires are usually lit by other players. The cooked fish generally have lower value and are not recommended to be sold to the general store. They can be banked at a bank deposit box located in Port Sarim and subsequently sold to other players or used as reliable food. To maximise the experience rate, players can login to a very busy world, take raw fish on the ground and cook them, trade to give away to players (the best way), or eat/drop them.Gerrant's Fishy BusinessVery shortSardineGerrant's Fishy Business in Port Sarim stocks 200 Raw Sardines for 10 coins each with a rapid restock time, making it a readily available supply of low level fish to cook for a low cost. Fires can be lit indoors using logs from the trees outside, allowing for both the purchase and cooking of the Sardines in extremely close proximity.

===== Pay-to-play Firemaking training =====
This article gives tips about training the Firemaking skill.

Levels 1–99: Burning logs

Burning logs is one of the fastest ways to train Firemaking. The best place to do this is at the eastern part of the Grand Exchange. The area has a lot of empty space and the bank is only one tile away from an area a log can be burned. When correctly timed, the player can move to another square in between lighting the logs, which allows the player to burn the logs in any formation. With fast enough banking and accurate clicks, it is possible to keep lighting the logs tick-perfectly every 4 ticks. Having noted logs in the inventory and unnoting them at the banker is recommended over using the bank interface.

An easier but a slower method is to simply burn logs in a row from east to west. The best place to do this is at Varrock: use Varrock Teleport, light the logs from the fountain and bank at the Varrock west bank. Alternatively, players can use Camelot Teleport and bank at Seers' Village.

The table below assumes 1,485 logs are burned per hour. Due to lower rates of success, it is recommended to use campfires for levels below around 35. However, since coloured logs are guaranteed to be lit successfully, these can be used without campfires.

Other methods
Levels 1–99: Burning logs on a campfire
Burning logs on a forester's campfire is a low-effort alternative to the faster methods. Choose a location where a campfire can be lit right next to a bank, such as the Grand Exchange, Rogues' Den, or the Crafting Guild. Burning an inventory of logs takes around 150 seconds.

Experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The first log added to the campfire takes 6 ticks to burn, and the following logs take 9 ticks. Allowing the logs to continue to be added to the campfire automatically results in roughly 665 logs burned per hour, while tending to the campfire manually while holding down spacebar results in up to 975 logs per hour.

Levels 1–50: Creating pyre logs

Creating pyre logs is a slow but potentially profitable alternative to burning logs at lower levels. This is done by using sacred oil on logs, which requires completion of the Shades of Mort'ton quest. Pyre logs can be created at level 1, even if the logs would require a higher level to burn.

While creating pyre logs requires the usage of a make-all interface, it is possible to rapidly create pyre logs by holding down space and rapidly using sacred oil on logs, similar to 1-tick cooking karambwans.

Experience rates vary depending on click speed and accuracy. Players can gain around 55,000 experience per hour with typical click speeds, including banking and given that one pyre log is made per tick (0.6 seconds). It is possible to get much higher rates, but they realistically cap at around 80,000 experience per hour for fastest sustainable click speeds.

Note: Prices may vary, and re-selling the pyre logs might prove difficult if demand is low. Check trade volume and actual prices in the Grand Exchange before using this method for profit.

Levels 50–99: Wintertodt
right|179x179px
Subduing Wintertodt from level 50 Firemaking onwards is a slower, but profitable and low-effort alternative to burning logs. It also grants passive Woodcutting experience from chopping the bruma roots, and the Pyromancer outfit, which increases Firemaking experience by 2.5%.
The fastest way to gain Firemaking experience from Wintertodt is to be on an official World (307, 309, 311, 389), which have fast games that usually last around 4 minutes. Light a brazier as soon as the round starts, chop bruma roots until you have a full inventory and burn them in the brazier. Fix and relight the brazier if needed. Fletching the bruma roots into kindlings is only recommended when the player would not meet the 500-point mark for the extra experience gained at the end of the round. Otherwise, bruma roots should not be fletched into kindlings as this significantly hampers experience rates.

Players can gain extra experience in between rounds by doing other activities during the downtime, such as burning logs, fletching darts or making jugs of wine.

Experience rates scale depending on the player's level. It takes around 600 rounds and 50 hours (assuming an average kill length of 4 minutes and a 60 second pause) to get from level 50 to level 99 Firemaking if you fletch every log, and about 500 rounds and 40 hours if you do not.

===== Free-to-play Firemaking training =====
Training
The fastest Firemaking experience is gained by burning the highest-tier log available. The best place to do this tick-perfectly is at the eastern part of the Grand Exchange, as the bank is only one tile away from an area a log can be burned and the area has a lot of empty space. When correctly timed, the player can move to another square in between lighting the logs, which allows the player to burn the logs in any formation. The player should have noted logs in the inventory, and use them on a banker while standing 2 steps away when banking for more logs. A log is lit every 4 game ticks or 2.4 seconds, meaning a theoretical perfect rate of 1,500 logs per hour; the table below assumes 1,485 logs lit per hour.

An easier but a slower method is to simply burn logs in a row from east to west. The best place to do this is at Varrock: use Varrock Teleport, light the logs from the fountain and bank at the Varrock west bank.

Additionally, with the introduction of Forestry, players can utilize the Forester's Campfire as a method of AFK Firemaking training at the same Firemaking experience per log although much slower this way.

Level 1–99
This section will show the time and number of logs needed to reach level 99 Firemaking if switching to each newly unlocked log type you can burn as soon as possible. It would take a player approximately 44 hours to reach level 99 Firemaking from level 1 if switching to each newly unlocked log type that they can burn as soon as possible.

Level 1–15: Normal logs
 The quickest way to get from level 1 to level 15 is by burning normal logs, which grant 40 experience per log. Normal logs from trees, evergreen, dead and dying trees can be cut nearly everywhere in Gielinor ranging from Lumbridge to the Wilderness. Purchasing the logs for 1 to 15 Firemaking is not necessary as getting level 15 is only several minute's work; only 61 logs have to be burnt to raise Firemaking from level 1 to 15. One must cut normal logs to train the first levels of Woodcutting anyway, so one may as well burn these logs to obtain 15 Firemaking.

Level 15–30: Oak logs
 The quickest way to get from level 15 to level 30 is by burning oak logs, which grant 60 experience per log. Oak trees can be cut almost everywhere. Level 15 Woodcutting to cut the oak logs may be useful; oak logs can also be bought from other players.

Level 30–45: Willow logs
 The quickest way to get from level 30 to level 45 is by burning willow logs, which grant 90 experience per log. Willow logs can be bought from other players or they can be cut with a Woodcutting level of at least 30. Willow trees can be cut near the River Lum in Lumbridge, near Edgeville, near the sea south of Draynor Village bank, south of the cabbage patch north-west of Draynor Village, or in Rimmington.
Experience needed: 48,149
Willow logs needed: 535

Money spent: 

Level 45–60: Maple logs
 The quickest way to get from level 45 to level 60 is by burning maple logs, which grant 135 experience per log. Free to play players may cut them or purchase them via the Grand Exchange. Many players choose to burn maple logs from level 45 until level 99.
Experience needed: 212,230
Maple logs needed: 1,572
Time: 1 hour 2 minutes 53 seconds (3,773 seconds)
Money spent: 

Level 60–99: Yew logs
 The fastest way to get from level 60 to level 99 is by burning yew logs, which grant 202.5 experience per log. These can be cut yourself, but it is much more efficient overall to buy them from other players. Though faster, this method is considerably more expensive than burning willow or maple logs.

Level 45–99: Maple logs
 The cheapest way to get from level 45 to level 99 is by burning maple logs, which grants 135 experience per log. Currently, maple logs ( coins) are cheaper than willow logs ( coins), so this method is recommended for free-to-players on a budget. As maple logs give 45 more experience per log than willows and cost  less coins, this method is strictly better than burning willow logs once players reach level 45, and is the most cost-efficient method overall for those not utilising yew logs.

===== Pay-to-play Woodcutting training =====
This guide outlines the best methods for training the Woodcutting skill. The profit from Woodcutting is low compared to other money-making methods and the profitable methods offer very slow experience per hour. Some players may find it more beneficial to perform the fastest experience methods and use the saved time to make money from other activities.

For maximum theoretical experience rates for certain Woodcutting training methods, see this page.

Equipment
thumb|154px|The crystal felling axe.
The only item required to cut wood is an axe, either equipped or in a player's inventory. Felling axes offer 10% more Woodcutting experience than their regular counterparts when used with Forester's rations. Using the best felling axe available will offer the fastest experience rates.

Felling axes up to dragon and the forester's rations can be bought from the Grand Exchange. The crystal felling axe is untradeable and can only be created by using a felling axe handle on a regular crystal axe while standing near a singing bowl. As such, using the crystal felling axe effectively requires completion of Song of the Elves. The felling axes below rune are uncommonly traded at the Grand Exchange and they are relatively expensive for how long they are used, so using normal axes below level 41 Woodcutting is advised.

Both the Forestry outfit and the Lumberjack outfit provide a total of 2.5% bonus experience per log cut, and is worth getting timewise for level 99 Woodcutting. The Temple Trekking minigame is the fastest way to obtain the Lumberjack outfit. When using route 1 and evading all the events except the one with undead lumberjacks, it will only take less than an hour to get the full set. Alternatively, the Forestry outfit can be obtained from participating in Forestry events and buying the outfit pieces with anima-infused bark.

The dragon axe special attack can be used to temporarily boost one's Woodcutting level by 3, which stacks with the level bonus provided by the Woodcutting Guild. Equipping the Lightbearer will also allow the player to use the special attack more often. The temporary level boost can be extended with the Preserve prayer. With the clothes pouch attached to the Forestry kit, the player can wear prayer armour to reduce prayer drain while also getting the Woodcutting experience boost from the Lumberjack outfit. In addition, equipping the log basket may be beneficial if players are saving space in their inventory or saving their logs in the future for training Firemaking, Hunter, and Fletching.

Fastest experience
To gain Woodcutting experience most efficiently, players should always drop the logs they cut. Players should quickly drop their items by holding the shift key and clicking on the logs, or enabling tap-to-drop on mobile.

Levels 1–26: Questing
Completing Monk's Friend, Enlightened Journey, Icthlarin's Little Helper, and the Skrach Uglogwee subquest of Recipe for Disaster grants a total of 9,000 experience. This will get the player from level 1 to 26.

Levels 1–15: Regular trees
From level 1 to 15, the player should cut regular trees. Each log gives 25 Woodcutting experience. 97 logs are required to reach level 15.

Levels 15–35: Oak trees
From level 15 to 35, the player should cut oak trees. Each log gives 37.5 Woodcutting experience. 534 logs are required to reach level 35.

Even though willow trees become available at level 30, cutting oak trees offers slightly faster experience at these levels.

Levels 35–99: Teak trees
Cutting teak trees offers the fastest Woodcutting experience in the game when using tick manipulation. If the player is not using any sort of tick manipulation, cutting teak trees offers the fastest experience only up to level 65.
thumb|1.5-tick Woodcutting on Fossil Island.
1.5-tick woodcutting teaks on Fossil Island is the fastest training method in the game. 1.5-tick woodcutting is done by setting up a 3-tick cycle (such as using swamp tar on a clean herb) and alternating tiles next to the hardwood patches. When timed correctly, the player has a chance to receive two logs at once every three ticks. Planted teak trees have a 1/8 chance to fell and they do not have a depletion timer, unlike the teak trees found elsewhere.

Using the best felling axe available with forester's rations will offer the fastest experience rates. The forester's rations also restore run energy, which makes stamina potions unnecessary for this method.

Experience rates for 1.5-tick woodcutting are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the best regular axe available up to level 61, the dragon felling axe for levels 61–71, and the crystal felling axe from level 71 onwards. Long-term rates can vary depending on performance. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to around 255,000 experience per hour at level 99 when using the crystal felling axe. Because the method is difficult and click-intensive, players are more likely to see rates closer to 230,000–240,000 experience per hour.

  level XP/h 35 93,000 41 115,000 50 126,000 61 173,000 71 194,000 80 208,000 90 222,000 99 235,000

thumb|2-tick Woodcutting on Ape Atoll.

2-tick woodcutting teaks is a slightly slower, but less attention- and click-intensive alternative to 1.5-tick woodcutting teaks on Fossil Island. 2-tick woodcutting is done by auto-retaliating to being attacked every two ticks and clicking on a tree. When done correctly, the player has a chance to receive logs every two ticks instead of four due to the way Auto Retaliate works.

Players can 2-tick teaks on Ape Atoll and the Isle of Souls using birds, or in Prifddinas using rabbits. In Prifddinas the player will gain some crystal shards.

To start 2-tick woodcutting, draw aggressiveness from the birds or rabbits without killing them (such as casting Confuse or Weaken). Equip a 2-tick or 3-tick weapon that cannot perform attacks, such as a shortbow on rapid without ammunition. Turn on Auto Retaliate and get two monsters attacking you such that a hitsplat appears every two ticks. This can be accomplished by walking under the monsters if they are on the same tile to split them up, then getting one stuck on a tree or bush. When this is done, manoeuvre the two around until you are stood between two teak trees with both enemies attacking you. On each tick that a hitsplat appears on the player click a teak tree, and on each off-tick either click the ground at the base of a teak tree or drop a teak log.

Players with low Defence may be hit by birds and can minimise the damage they take by using a regen bracelet and a Hunters' crossbow with a shield instead of a shortbow. Rabbits are unable to hit the player.

Experience rates for 2-tick woodcutting are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the best regular axe available up to level 61, the dragon felling axe for levels 61–71, and the crystal felling axe from level 71 onwards. Long-term rates can vary depending on performance. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to 223,000 experience per hour at level 99 when using the crystal felling axe.

Without tick manipulation it is recommended to cut teaks only up to level 65, after which cutting sulliusceps offers faster experience. The experience rates for cutting teaks without tick manipulation are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the best regular axe available up to level 61, the dragon felling axe for levels 61–71, and the crystal felling axe from level 71 onwards. Equipping a forestry kit and completing the forestry events that spawn can increase the rates by roughly 20,000 experience per hour.

Other methods
Forestry events
Participating in Forestry events offers decent Woodcutting experience and some profit from purchasing the rewards with anima-infused bark. Forestry events will appear while collecting logs in the overworld (excluding regular trees, hollow trees, and trees within the Woodcutting Guild).

The official forestry worlds for members are 388, 444, 487, and 510. Using one of these worlds is recommended, as they are likely to have more players chopping trees in popular locations, such as:
 Willows south of the Draynor Village bank
 Maple trees in Mistrock, south of Aldarin (1 tile away from a bank deposit box, 5 tiles away from a bank)
 Maple trees north of the Seers' Village bank
 Yews in Mistrock, south of Aldarin (4 tiles away from a bank deposit box, 9 tiles away from a bank)
 Yews at the Seers' Village church
 Yews next to the south-eastern bank in Prifddinas
 Teaks on the northern part of Isle of Souls
 Teaks in the north-east corner of Prifddinas
 Magic trees in the Myths' Guild
 Magic trees south of the Hosidius bank

Experience rates vary depending on the tree cut and the amount of other players. When cutting yews and participating in the events, players can gain somewhere around 80,000–90,000 experience per hour at level 99.

Levels 62–90: Blisterwood tree
Cutting the blisterwood tree in Darkmeyer becomes a viable low-effort alternative at level 62. To access the tree in Darkmeyer, players must have partially completed Sins of the Father. The blisterwood tree never depletes, but there is a 1/10 chance that the player stops cutting it, after which the player will need to click the tree again to continue cutting it. There is an obvious sound effect to indicate when this happens, allowing for afk training. Players can gain up to around 69,000 experience per hour prior to level 90, and up to 86,000 experience per hour using a crystal felling axe and forester's rations. Alternatively, as the logs provide decent Firemaking experience when burned, they can be used for passive Firemaking training by using an infernal axe instead.

Levels 65–99: Sulliuscep

Cutting sulliuscep mushroom trees on Fossil Island is a low-effort alternative that offers the fastest experience when not using tick manipulation. Sulliusceps are located in the Tar Swamp, which is in the south-western part of the island. There are six sulliusceps found throughout swamp, but only one is large enough to be chopped down at any given time, while all other locations will have sulliuscep sprouts in their location. Players must traverse the Tar Swamp to find the choppable sulliuscep, the location of which is unique to each player. Once chopped, the next sulliuscep will spawn, the location of which cycles through the same sequence over and over.

To access Fossil Island, players must have completed Bone Voyage. When in the swamp, players must also be able to withstand occasional attacks from tar monsters and spine mushrooms. The Spine mushrooms can also poison the player, so bringing a form of antipoison, such as an antidote++ or the prayer book, is also recommended. When wearing the Hitpoints cape and the regen bracelet, very little healing is usually required. Teleporting back to your POH and using your restoration pool after chopping the final sulliuscep with the gear shown will mitigate the need to have food or Saradomin Brews in your inventory.

World 321 is the designated world for cutting sulliusceps. However, it is better to have as few players as possible when sulliuscep cutting to reduce damage taken, as Tar Monsters spawned by other players may target the player.

Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume wearing the lumberjack outfit. If using this method from level 65 to 99; 97,778 sulliuscep chops are needed when wearing the lumberjack outfit.

  Level XP/h   65 82,700  71 86,300 89,500 80 91,600 94,800 90 97,400 100,100 99 101,900 105,000

Assuming players keep the sulliuscep caps, numulite, and unidentified fossils, on average players obtain approximately the following numbers of items when chopping the 97,778 sulliusceps required for 99 woodcutting from 65:
 978 sulliuscep caps, worth 
 264,000 numulite, worth 
 1,399 unidentified small fossils, 70 of which are required for the Varrock museum, leaving 1329 unidentified small fossils to be used for Prayer experience at the mycelium pool.
 698 unidentified medium fossils, 60 of which are required for the museum, leaving 638 unidentified medium fossils for Prayer experience.
 559 unidentified large fossils, at least 50 of which are required for the museum. The player should clean fossils until at least 25 large and 25 plant fossils have been obtained. Plant fossils cannot be used in the mycelium pool, however unidentified large fossils can. Hence, the player should stop cleaning large fossils once the museum has been completed.
 140 unidentified rare fossils, which can only be used for Prayer experience.

Through completing the Varrock museum fossil exhibit, 120,000 experience is obtained in skills of choice. The remaining 1,329 small, 638 medium, 509 large, and 140 rare fossils may then be converted at the mycelium pool, calcifying them using pyrophosphite and calcite. The recalcified bones can then be used on the most eastern strange machine in the House on the Hill for a total of  Prayer experience. This amount of prayer experience would be worth  at the Chaos altar in the Wilderness using dragon bones. The expected average experience rate is 580,000 experience per hour for recalcifying and converting the fossils obtained from Woodcutting, which takes on average about 4 hours and 20 minutes in total.

Levels 88/89/90–99: Redwood trees
Cutting redwood trees in the Woodcutting Guild requires very little attention and offers decent experience. Players can bank the logs in the nearby bank chest. It is faster to simply drop the logs for the best experience rates. Fletching logs into stackable arrow shafts can also be convenient if the player would like to put less effort, as this does not require dropping logs. This will lower experience rates, however.

Experience rates scale depending on level. When using the infernal or the dragon axe, players can expect to gain around 55,000–60,000 experience per hour at level 90, increasing to around 65,000 experience per hour at level 99. With the crystal axe, players can gain up to around 70,000–75,000 experience per hour.

Similar to teak trees, redwood trees in the Farming Guild can be cut using 1.5t woodcutting for up to 180,000 experience per hour using a crystal axe. This is especially useful for Ironman accounts looking to bank redwood logs.

Redwoods can be cut reliably starting from level 88 using the Dragon axe special attack, a Lightbearer, and the Preserve prayer. Players should also wear as much prayer boosting equipment as possible to reduce the drain rate of Preserve. At level 89, Preserve is no longer required as the Lightbearer will almost always restore the player's special attack energy before their level drops back below 90 unless the special attack was activated in the last segment (12 seconds) of the boost cycle. 

Experience rates/profit at level 99
Players may earn more experience (and its respective profit) with the felling axe/rations, Forestry/Lumberjack outfit, and other experience-boosting items.

Note: The profit per hour for some logs is interpolated, and as such, may only be used as an approximation.

Recommended tree locations
Regular trees
These are the most abundant of all tree varieties in Old School RuneScape, and can be found nearly anywhere. Because regular trees only provide a single log per tree, it is recommended to find an area with multiple trees; simply use the World Map to find a suitable location that has a bank nearby. Note that dead trees and evergreen trees all count as regular trees.

Oak trees
Hosidius bank in Kourend is the closest spot for an oak tree to a bank deposit box a few tiles away.
Quite a few are found just south of the Seers' Village bank. This is perhaps the most convenient location due to its proximity to a bank.
Outside of the Castle Wars lobby, there is a large amount of oak trees that are close to bank.
Three can be found along the path between Falador park and Falador west bank.
Just east of the Draynor Village bank. Low level players should be careful here, as aggressive level 26 Jail guards patrol the area.
Just outside the Varrock gates west of the west bank and east of the east bank.
Tree Gnome Stronghold has some fairly close to its respective bank.
10 can be found along the southern Falador wall just north of the Falador farm, but it is quite far away from a bank compared to these other locations.

Willow trees
7 willow trees by the pond in the Woodcutting Guild, in addition to the guild's invisible Woodcutting boost there is a nearby deposit box inside Perry's Chop-chop Shop.
5 willow trees south of Draynor Village bank. Any players below combat level 15 should beware of the level 7 dark wizards, who will be aggressive.
8 willow trees immediately west of the Hot Air Balloon by the Crafting Guild, with a bank chest available inside the guild.
6 willow trees found north-west of the Seers' Village bank.
8 willow trees along the eastern coast outside of Barbarian Outpost, with a bank chest nearby in the building that houses the Barbarian Assault minigame.
12 willow trees around the pond north of the Tithe Farm, with a bank chest further north in the Vinery.

Teak trees
One tree is located south-west of Castle Wars.
Three trees are located south-east of the Ruins of Uzer.
On the south-east side of Ape Atoll (requires greegree at all times or completion of Monkey Madness II) but is not near a bank.
Hardwood Grove in Tai Bwo Wannai (requires completion of Jungle Potion, 100 Trading sticks for entrance and some progress of the Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup minigame), you can bank nearby with Rionasta.
3 Hardwood tree patches are located on Fossil Island, where you could plant 3 private Teak trees for yourself. The tree patches are located besides each other within 3 tiles. As well as a bank which is located very close to these tree patches. The bank is accessed even faster using the shortcut through the hill which requires 70 Agility.
1 potential Teak tree in Avium Savannah in Valamore upon competition of The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute quest by utilizing the hardwood tree patch.
2 trees are located north of Mos Le'Harmless by going through the cave.
3 can be found in the north-east corner of Prifddinas.
3 can be found in the northern area of The Isle of Souls.
6 trees are located at the Locus Oasis.

Maple trees
13 maple trees in the Woodcutting Guild, popular due to the invisible +7 boost to the player's Woodcutting level and proximity to a bank chest.
7 maple trees near the Seers' Village bank (four to the north, three to the south). Popular due to its location and the 10% experience bonus granted with the medium Kandarin Diary's completion.

===== Free-to-play Woodcutting training =====
This guide outlines the best methods for training the Woodcutting skill in free-to-play.

General tips
To optimise your Woodcutting experience gained, it's generally fastest to drop your logs instead of banking to save the time that would be spent travelling to and from the bank. Whether or not to drop logs depends on the player's ability to quickly drop an entire inventory of logs versus the travel time to and from the nearest bank. For instance, some players may find that when cutting willow trees very close to the bank in Draynor Village, it may be faster and less stressful to bank the logs instead of dropping them.

For players with a Firemaking level below 45, it can be efficient to burn logs as they are cut; however, once a Firemaking level of 45 has been reached, it is more time efficient to drop/bank low-level logs from training Woodcutting and use the saved time to build up money to burn maple logs or yew logs instead. Alternatively, players can create a forester's campfire next to any tree they're cutting as a slower but less intensive way of gaining Firemaking experience while Woodcutting.

Forestry
With the release of Forestry, players receive an invisible boost to their Woodcutting level when cutting trees alongside other players (+1 per player up to a maximum of +10), and trees despawn on a timer and do not disappear more quickly with more players cutting them. This means that when cutting higher level trees such as willow trees it is ideal to use a popular Woodcutting location while logged in on a Forestry world, or any other hotspot world with many players cutting the same tree.

If at least one player is cutting a tree using a forestry kit, it is possible for the tree to spawn a Forestry event. Free-to-play worlds can spawn the Struggling sapling, Rising roots, and Friendly ent events, and these reward anima-infused bark which can be used to purchase the valuable felling axe handle. These events can give higher Woodcutting experience per hour than cutting normally, thus it is recommended to use a forestry kit while cutting trees on mass worlds.

The probability of spawning an event increases when chopping a high-level tree, chopping with 10 other players on the same tree, or both. Below are popular areas where players can spawn events in free-to-play worlds:
+TreePopular AreasOakEast of Draynor Village bankWillowSouth of Draynor Village bankMapleCorsair Cove Resource AreaYewNorth of Varrock Palace, South of Edgeville

Axes
Axes are required to train Woodcutting; they range in quality from bronze to rune. Each tier up has a higher chance to successfully cut a tree and thus it is recommended to always use the highest tier axe available. If the Attack level requirement is met, save an inventory space by equipping the axe.

Levels 1–99
Levels 1–15: Trees
 Starting Woodcutting requires cutting trees from level 1 to 15, which grants 25 experience per log.

Trees are found throughout Gielinor. There are large patches of trees south of the Grand Exchange, west of Lumbridge Castle, or outside Draynor Manor. Doing so south of the Grand Exchange allows for easily selling logs as they are cut.

 Starting experience: 0
 Experience required: 2,411
 Logs required: 97 (2,425 experience)
 Profit: 

Levels 15–30/60/99: Oak trees
 At level 15, it is recommended to start cutting oak trees, which grant 37.5 experience per log.

Oak trees are found throughout Gielinor. There are several oak tree spots: there are trees south-west of Varrock west bank, two behind Lumbridge General Store, some south of Falador's southern gates and near Port Sarim, and more east of Rimmington. If banking the logs, it is recommended to use the trees near Varrock west bank. There is also one oak tree just outside Falador west bank and another oak tree near Draynor Village's bank that are both very convenient for banking logs.

2-tick oaks

Using the same technique as 2-tick teaks for members, Auto Retaliate can be used for tick manipulation by artificially resetting the cooldown before a log can be cut.

First, bring a shortbow with no arrows and your best Woodcutting axe in your inventory. Also bring mind runes, air runes, and equip a set of iron with a kiteshield in order to splash. Around six energy potions are also highly recommended.

Just outside the southern Falador gates are two oak trees that are reachable from a single tile, which are also within range of two rats at the nearby farm that can be dragged over to the oaks by splashing Wind Strike, or alternatively by using Confuse. The rat spawn locations are given in the map. Usually, the rats do not end up anywhere close to the trees automatically, so they have to be led there each time manually. They spawn in the fenced area west of the main farm house on death, and must be led from there through the house and around the south-western fence, hugging the fence on the southern side. This can be very tricky since only the area very close to the trees is multicombat, and the entire trip is at the border of the rats' maximum movement range. It's effective to lure one at a time from the farm house around the fence and as far north as it can go along the road (just north of the oak trees) and then go back for the second one. If the first one wandered too far back from the trees, then drag the second one as far as it will go, then go back to drag the first, and repeat. This process can take over three minutes to drag both rats to the trees.

Once both rats are led to the trees and are both attacking you in multicombat, switch to your shortbow and use Rapid attack style with Auto Retaliate on and no arrows equipped. Keep walking back and forth on the three tiles between the two oaks, standing on the rats and moving around a few tiles at a time until the two rats stagger their attack animations to attack once every two ticks. Then, on the ticks that the 0 hitsplats are landing on you, click one of the two trees, and on the alternating ticks, either drop a log from your inventory or click underneath you/underneath the tree such that the game registers an action but does not move you. This gives you a chance at a log every 2 ticks instead of 4, and continuing this alternating pattern of clicking the tree and dropping logs allows you to cut oak trees at twice the normal speed without interruption.

From 60 Woodcutting onwards using a rune axe, it is possible to get up to a theoretical maximum of 112k experience per hour with 2-tick oaks. The same or similar experience rates are also obtainable with an adamant axe at level 78 Woodcutting onwards, or a mithril axe at 99 Woodcutting.

Levels 30/60–99: Willow trees
 At level 30, players can cut willow trees, which grant 67.5 experience per log.

If dropping logs, oak trees are higher experience rates until level 60, however because willow logs are closer to the bank in Draynor Village compared to the oak trees near Varrock west bank, banking oak and willow logs makes the experience rates equal. 

Experience rates are about 35% higher than those achieved when cutting maple trees, however maples are a more AFK method.

The best places to chop willow trees are south-west of the bank in Draynor Village, but beware of aggressive dark wizards. There is also one tree East of Edgeville that is very close to a bank. If a bank isn't required, or if you are level 3 and don't want the dark wizard attacking you, there are more trees just east of the Rusty Anchor Inn in Port Sarim, with a nearby bank deposit box just south on the docks next to the monks. There are more trees west of Farmer Fred's house in Lumbridge, south of the Port Sarim jail, south-east of Rimmington, and east of the Champions' Guild.

3-tick willows with snow
Players who have completed a Christmas event and have unlocked the snow globe can attempt to use snow for tick manipulation; this gives a chance to cut a willow log every 3 ticks instead of the normal delay of 4 ticks between receiving logs, increasing experience rates by 33.3%. Find a secluded area where you can cut from two willow trees without moving from a single spot. Then, choose the snow option on the snow globe to drop a pile of snow underneath you; there is a delay of 7 ticks before the snow appears. To 3-tick with snow, on tick 1 click the snow, on tick 2 shift-click to drop a set of willow logs from your inventory, and on tick 3 click the willow tree, and repeat this 3-tick pattern. Because snow lasts only 24 ticks and there must be an empty tick with no snow between snowdrops, you have to remember every 25 ticks to click snow on your snow globe. The ideal tick to operate your snow globe for the next pile of snow is on the 18th tick when the current snow is active. The best way to time operating your snow globe every 25 ticks is to create a custom music track or metronome to listen to that plays a sound every 25th beat at 100 beats per minute.

3-tick willows give one of the highest possible Woodcutting experience rates in free-to-play, capping out at a maximum of 85,000 experience per hour at level 99 Woodcutting.

Levels 45–99: Maple trees
 At level 45, players can cut maple trees, which grant 100 experience per log.

Experience rates are about 35% lower than willow trees (when not using tick manipulation), however maples are easier to AFK as they take more time to cut therefore allowing a more relaxed style of grinding. At level 80 Woodcutting, it is possible to obtain 36,000 experience per hour without tick manipulation.

The only place where free-to-play players can cut maple trees is the Corsair Cove Resource Area which has 4 trees and is very far from a bank. It requires completion of Dragon Slayer I to enter. Free-to-play players must start The Corsair Curse to access Corsair Cove where the resource area is located.

Other methods
Levels 60–99: Yew trees
 At level 60, players can cut yew trees, which grant 175 experience per log. While yew logs earn a profit, it is recommended to cut willow or maple trees for experience and use the time saved to earn money doing more profitable methods.

The best place to chop yew trees is south of Edgeville bank, as there are two trees close to a bank and each other. Banking can also be made even faster by swapping to the PvP world to bank whenever your inventory fills, as the free-to-play PvP world has a bank extremely close to the yews. Note that the yews are in a PvP zone, but the bank in the building is a safe zone, so as long as the player swaps worlds inside the safe zone, there's no risk of death from another player. The next best location to cut yews is behind the Varrock Palace east of the Grand Exchange, and there are also 3 trees south of Falador east bank and another 3 between Lumbridge and Draynor.

===== Farming training =====
Farming training focuses heavily on doing tree runs, which is a recurring training method. Much like daily events and recurring money making methods, tree runs give Farming experience passively over time since it is possible to only do 1 or 2 runs per day. Instead of actively training the skill for hours, players only spend a few minutes to do a run, gaining a lot of Farming experience during that short amount of time, and then do other activities while waiting for the patches to grow. While trees take a very long while to grow in real time, players spend very little time actively doing tree runs.

Doing tree runs costs money, and certain saplings and protection payments can be quite expensive. It is recommended to have a decent amount of money to be able to buy a lot of Farming supplies at once, and have a good money making method to sustain the cost of doing tree runs. Herb runs are often highly profitable and they also offer a fair amount of Farming experience, but usually it is better to look into money making alternatives that offer better profit.

Starting off
Levels 1–38: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Farming experience. Completing the Goblin generals subquest of Recipe for Disaster, Fairytale I - Growing Pains, Forgettable Tale... (requires 17 Farming), The Garden of Death (requires 20 Farming), Garden of Tranquillity (requires 25 Farming), Enlightened Journey (requires 30 Farming), and My Arm's Big Adventure (requires 29 Farming) grants a total of 32,500 experience, which will get the player up to level 38. This skips much of the tedium of low-level Farming and allows the player to do effective farm runs immediately.

Levels 1–15: Bagged plants
The fastest way to train the early levels is to plant bagged plants in the player-owned house. However, it is significantly more expensive than planting seeds.

If the garden supplier does not have enough stock, players can hop worlds to buy more bagged plants.

The quickest way to plant them, assuming that your house is in Rimmington, is to bring three watering cans, a stack of coins, and as many noted bagged plants as you can afford. You can hand your notes to Phials to un-note them (for a small fee) and refill your watering cans in the building just east of the well. 

Right-click the plant space and click on Build. To make the process even faster, spam the 1 button while planting and removing the bagged plants. This will select the bagged plant and confirm the removal, allowing you to plant and remove plants very quickly.

Bagged plants are one of the only ways to actively train farming without waiting for anything to grow.

Levels 1–15: Making supercompost/ultracompost
Another option to train the early levels is to make supercompost or ultracompost in a compost bin. Each bucket of supercompost grants 8.5 farming experience, or 10 experience with the addition of volcanic ash to produce ultracompost.

Watermelons and pineapples are the easiest candidates for the produce used, with the latter easily purchased in convenient quantities from Trader Stan's Trading Post.

Levels 1–15: Farming allotments
Seed Table
Farming/Patch locations
Farming runs

Levels 1–15: Sorceress's garden
In the Sorceress's Garden minigame, players can pick sq'irk fruits or herbs from the gardens. No Thieving level is required, but a higher Thieving level increases Thieving experience rates. Picking a sq'irk from the tree yields 30, 40, 50, or 60 Farming experience depending on the room's season. Completing the winter garden to 15 requires 81 laps. Picking from the herb patch yields 50 Farming experience and two random herbs from any garden which requires 49 laps.

This method, once the gardens are set up correct for 1-click methods, is one of the least click-intensive ways to train. Training using only this method from 65 to 99 Thieving yields 503,520 Farming experience.

Levels 15–99: Tree runs
right|321x321px

Tree runs are the most effective way to gain Farming experience. To do this, plant the highest-tier tree, fruit tree, and hardwood tree saplings available, along with the special tree saplings (calquat, celastrus, crystal, and redwood). After the trees have grown, check the health of a fully grown tree for Farming experience, pay the gardener to chop down the tree, then replant the tree. Repeat until all patches have been checked and replanted.

While tree runs are a passive training method, they offer by far the fastest effective experience. For example, if it took the player 5 minutes to do a tree run and the player gained 100,000 Farming experience from the run, the experience rate would effectively be 1,200,000 experience per hour (12 runs per one actively spent hour). Players would only spend 5 minutes on doing a run, then do something else while the trees grow.

A tree run consisting of 6 magic trees, 6 dragonfruit trees, 1 calquat tree, and 1 celastrus tree takes around 5 minutes and 20 seconds. The run gives a total of 215,761.3 Farming experience when using payments, which would offer around 2,400,000 experience per actively spent hour. When including 4 mahogany trees once every 4 days and a redwood tree once every 5 days, the effective rate is around 2,500,000 experience per actively spent hour.

Even though it is only possible to do 1 or 2 tree runs per day, doing tree runs over time ends up being much faster than doing methods that offer faster experience in real time, such as farming allotments. Tree runs should be the first priority for Farming training, and active training methods should only be done if Farming is the player's last skill to level 99. Getting level 99 Farming should take around 3–4 months at most if the player does tree runs fairly consistently.

General information and tips
Always pay the farmer to chop down the tree for replanting. This only costs a small amount of money and is much faster than chopping the tree. The celastrus tree has valuable harvest however, so it can be worthwhile to spend extra time to gather the celastrus barks.

It is best to pay the farmer to look after the tree, so it cannot die and players are guaranteed to get the Farming experience from checking the health of the tree. The tree patch in Falador Park will never get diseased after completing the elite Falador Diary. To save money, it can be worthwhile to treat certain patches with ultracompost instead of paying the farmer to look after the tree. This is slower overall however, because the tree will occasionally die and the player would have spent time for no experience gained. Reviving a dead tree with Resurrect Crops helps to reduce the number of trees lost this way.

Buy the saplings from the Grand Exchange. If seeking to save money, buy the tree seeds instead and grow them into saplings. Saplings are made by using a tree seed on a filled plant pot while having a gardening trowel in the inventory, using a watering can on the seedlings to water them and then waiting for them to grow into saplings. Saplings grow while stored in bank, so players do not have to have them in their inventory. Players who have level 68 Magic and have completed Dream Mentor can use Humidify spell to water the seedlings faster.

Regular trees are usually more expensive compared to the other trees. Players who are not in a rush to level up Farming are advised to only farm fruit trees, hardwood trees and special trees for cheaper experience. Depending on the prices, it can also be worthwhile to farm palm trees instead of dragonfruit trees at higher levels, as growing dragonfruit trees costs  per experience and palm trees would only cost  per experience, including the protection payments.

Saplings cannot be unnoted at a Tool Leprechaun. If there is not enough room to hold all the saplings needed, resupply at a bank during the run.

Farming boosts can be used to access different tiers of the Farming Guild before obtaining the level required. The level is only checked when attempting to enter the area.

Example tree runs
Start out at the Grand Exchange and buy all of the saplings, payments and teleports needed.

In the first run, the player will have to rake all of the patches. In subsequent runs, this is only necessary if a growth cycle happens in between removing the tree and planting a new one. It is recommended to leave a rake at a Tool Leprechaun in case this happens.

Example low-level tree run

This is an example setup for doing a tree run consisting of 6 trees, 5 fruit trees and 4 hardwood trees at level 35. This run does not include the Lletya fruit tree due to the quests required however the last step is shown as an example, nor the tree and fruit tree patches in the Farming Guild due to the Farming level requirements.

The route assumes the player pays the farmers to chop down the trees and to look after them.

Other methods
Herb runs
right|170x170px

Herb runs offer good profit, and decent Farming experience when growing high-level herbs such as torstols. Some players choose to do this to compensate the cost of doing tree runs, or to make money in general. Herbs take 80 minutes to grow. To gain extra Farming experience, players can farm allotments (such as snape grass) along with herb runs.

Always treat herb patches with ultracompost. This minimises the chance of disease, increases the expected yield, and ensures the minimum amount of 6 herbs per seed when used along with magic secateurs.

By default, three herb patches are available for the player, with the remaining seven requiring the following:

Morytania: Completed of Priest in Peril
Harmony Island: Completion of the elite Morytania Diary
Hosidius: Visit Kourend at least once
Farming Guild: 65 Farming
Troll Stronghold: Completed My Arm's Big Adventure
Weiss: Completed Making Friends with My Arm and additionally built a Fire of Nourishment by the patches
Civitas illa Fortis: Completed Children of the Sun

Magic secateurs
Bottomless compost bucket filled with ultracompost
Alternatively, ultracomposts can be brought, or runes for the Fertile Soil spell and volcanic ashes (after reading the ash covered tome)

Allotment runs
At level 47 Farming, players can add allotment runs alongside their herb runs. Allotments usually consist of two sets of farmable patches, with the exception of the one on Harmony Island, which only has one. This level allows players to start growing watermelons. Each harvested watermelon provides 54.5 experience, and a fair amount of watermelons can be harvested with ultracompost and magic secateurs.

Barring the patch on Harmony Island, all allotment patches are either watched by a gardener or have a flower patch. Players are highly encouraged to grow Nasturtiums on the flower patch, as this protects watermelons from disease and ensures they will never die, making yield the only priority. 

At level 61 Farming, players should replace the allotments with snape grass; each harvested spike of grass provides 82 experience. The nasturtiums should also be replaced with white lilies, as this protects all allotments from disease.

By default, three locations are available to the player, with the other six requiring quests and/or additional requirements:

Falador: No requirements
Catherby: No requirements
Ardougne: No requirements
Morytania: Completed Priest in Peril
Hosidius: Visit Kourend at least once
Farming Guild: 45 Farming
Harmony Island: Started The Great Brain Robbery
Prifddinas: Completion of Song of the Elves
Civitas illa Fortis: Completion of Children of the Sun

GP/XP calculations

Tithe Farm
At level 34, experience may be gained at the Tithe Farm minigame. In this way, players can gain significant Farming experience between the time it takes patches to grow, or train exclusively at the minigame to save money on seeds. From level 74 onwards, players can get around 90,000–100,000 experience per hour.

Exclusive rewards obtained through tithe farm can prove useful in training farming, such as the farmer's outfit, the seed box, and the gricoller's can.
