This
guide
outlines the best methods for training the
Woodcutting
skill
. The profit from Woodcutting is low compared to other money-making methods and the profitable methods offer very slow experience per hour. Some players may find it more beneficial to perform the fastest experience methods and use the saved time to make money from other activities.

Quests for Woodcutting experience
Equipment
The crystal felling axe.
The only item required to cut wood is an
axe
, either equipped or in a player's inventory.
Felling axes
offer 10% more Woodcutting experience than their regular counterparts when used with
Forester's rations
. Using the best felling axe available will offer the fastest experience rates.
Felling axes up to
dragon
and the forester's rations can be bought from the
Grand Exchange
. The
crystal felling axe
is untradeable and can only be created by using a
felling axe handle
on a regular
crystal axe
while standing near a singing bowl. As such, using the crystal felling axe effectively requires completion of
Song of the Elves
. The felling axes below
rune
are uncommonly traded at the Grand Exchange and they are relatively expensive for how long they are used, so using normal axes below level 41 Woodcutting is advised.
Both the
Forestry outfit
and the
Lumberjack outfit
provide a total of 2.5% bonus experience per log cut, and is worth getting timewise for level 99 Woodcutting. The
Temple Trekking
minigame is the fastest way to obtain the Lumberjack outfit. When using route 1 and evading all the events except the one with
undead lumberjacks
, it will only take less than an hour to get the full set. Alternatively, the Forestry outfit can be obtained from participating in
Forestry
events and buying the outfit pieces with
anima-infused bark
.
The
dragon axe
special attack
can be used to temporarily boost one's Woodcutting level by 3, which stacks with the level bonus provided by the
Woodcutting Guild
. Equipping the
Lightbearer
will also allow the player to use the special attack more often. The temporary level boost can be extended with the
Preserve
prayer. With the
clothes pouch
attached to the
Forestry kit
, the player can wear
prayer armour
to reduce prayer drain while also getting the Woodcutting experience boost from the Lumberjack outfit. In addition, equipping the
log basket
may be beneficial if players are saving space in their inventory or saving their logs in the future for training
Firemaking
,
Hunter
, and
Fletching
.
Fastest experience
To gain Woodcutting experience most efficiently, players should always drop the logs they cut. Players should quickly drop their items by holding the shift key and clicking on the logs, or enabling tap-to-drop on
mobile
.
Levels 1–26: Questing
Completing
Monk's Friend
,
Enlightened Journey
,
Icthlarin's Little Helper
, and the
Skrach Uglogwee subquest
of
Recipe for Disaster
grants a total of 9,000 experience. This will get the player from level 1 to 26.
Levels 1–15: Regular trees
From level 1 to 15, the player should cut
regular trees
. Each log gives 25 Woodcutting experience. 97 logs are required to reach level 15.
Levels 15–35: Oak trees
From level 15 to 35, the player should cut
oak trees
. Each log gives 37.5 Woodcutting experience. 534 logs are required to reach level 35.
Even though
willow trees
become available at level 30, cutting oak trees offers slightly faster experience at these levels.
Levels 35–99: Teak trees
Cutting
teak trees
offers the fastest Woodcutting experience in the game when using
tick manipulation
. If the player is not using any sort of tick manipulation, cutting teak trees offers the fastest experience only up to level 65.
1.5-tick Woodcutting on Fossil Island.
1.5-tick woodcutting
teaks on
Fossil Island
is the fastest training method in the game. 1.5-tick woodcutting is done by setting up a 3-tick cycle (such as using swamp tar on a clean herb) and alternating tiles next to the hardwood patches. When timed correctly, the player has a chance to receive two logs at once every three ticks. Planted teak trees have a 1/8 chance to fell and they do not have a depletion timer, unlike the teak trees found elsewhere.
Using the best felling axe available with forester's rations will offer the fastest experience rates. The forester's rations also restore run energy, which makes stamina potions unnecessary for this method.
Experience rates for 1.5-tick woodcutting are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the best regular axe available up to level 61, the dragon felling axe for levels 61–71, and the crystal felling axe from level 71 onwards. Long-term rates can vary depending on performance. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to around 255,000 experience per hour at level 99 when using the crystal felling axe. Because the method is difficult and click-intensive, players are more likely to see rates closer to 230,000–240,000 experience per hour.

2-tick Woodcutting on Ape Atoll.
2-tick woodcutting
teaks is a slightly slower, but less attention- and click-intensive alternative to 1.5-tick woodcutting teaks on Fossil Island. 2-tick woodcutting is done by auto-retaliating to being attacked every two ticks and clicking on a tree. When done correctly, the player has a chance to receive logs every two ticks instead of four due to the way
Auto Retaliate
works.
Players can 2-tick teaks on
Ape Atoll
and the
Isle of Souls
using
birds
, or in
Prifddinas
using
rabbits
. In Prifddinas the player will gain some
crystal shards
.
To start 2-tick woodcutting, draw aggressiveness from the birds or rabbits without killing them (such as casting
Confuse
or
Weaken
). Equip a 2-tick or 3-tick weapon that cannot perform attacks, such as a
shortbow
on rapid without ammunition. Turn on
Auto Retaliate
and get two monsters attacking you such that a hitsplat appears every two ticks. This can be accomplished by walking under the monsters if they are on the same tile to split them up, then getting one stuck on a tree or bush. When this is done, manoeuvre the two around until you are stood between two teak trees with both enemies attacking you. On each tick that a hitsplat appears on the player click a teak tree, and on each off-tick either click the ground at the base of a teak tree or drop a teak log.
Players with low
Defence
may be hit by birds and can minimise the damage they take by using a
regen bracelet
and a
Hunters' crossbow
with a shield instead of a shortbow. Rabbits are unable to hit the player.
Experience rates for 2-tick woodcutting are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the best regular axe available up to level 61, the dragon felling axe for levels 61–71, and the crystal felling axe from level 71 onwards. Long-term rates can vary depending on performance. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to 223,000 experience per hour at level 99 when using the crystal felling axe.

Without tick manipulation
it is recommended to cut teaks only up to level 65, after which cutting
sulliusceps
offers faster experience. The experience rates for cutting teaks without tick manipulation are shown in the table below. The rates assume using the best regular axe available up to level 61, the dragon felling axe for levels 61–71, and the crystal felling axe from level 71 onwards. Equipping a
forestry kit
and completing the
forestry events
that spawn can increase the rates by roughly 20,000 experience per hour.

Other methods
Forestry events
Participating in
Forestry
events offers decent Woodcutting experience and some profit from purchasing the rewards with anima-infused bark. Forestry events will appear while collecting logs in the overworld (excluding regular trees, hollow trees, and trees within the Woodcutting Guild).
The official forestry worlds for members are
388, 444, 487,
and
510.
Using one of these worlds is recommended, as they are likely to have more players chopping trees in popular locations, such as:
Willows south of the
Draynor Village
bank
Maple trees in
Mistrock
, south of Aldarin (1 tile away from a bank deposit box, 5 tiles away from a bank)
Maple trees north of the
Seers' Village
bank
Yews in
Mistrock
, south of Aldarin (4 tiles away from a bank deposit box, 9 tiles away from a bank)
Yews at the
Seers' Village
church
Yews next to the south-eastern bank in
Prifddinas
Teaks on the northern part of
Isle of Souls
Teaks in the north-east corner of
Prifddinas
Magic trees in the
Myths' Guild
Magic trees south of the
Hosidius
bank
Experience rates vary depending on the tree cut and the amount of other players. When cutting yews and participating in the events, players can gain somewhere around 80,000–90,000 experience per hour at level 99.
Levels 62–90: Blisterwood tree
Cutting the
blisterwood tree
in
Darkmeyer
becomes a viable low-effort alternative at level 62. To access the tree in Darkmeyer, players must have partially completed
Sins of the Father
. The blisterwood tree never depletes, but there is a 1/10 chance that the player stops cutting it, after which the player will need to click the tree again to continue cutting it. There is an obvious sound effect to indicate when this happens, allowing for afk training. Players can gain up to around 69,000 experience per hour prior to level 90, and up to 86,000 experience per hour using a
crystal felling axe
and
forester's rations
. Alternatively, as the logs provide decent
Firemaking
experience when burned, they can be used for passive Firemaking training by using an
infernal axe
instead.
Levels 65–99: Sulliuscep
Main article:
Sulliuscep/Strategies
10000
Cutting
sulliuscep
mushroom trees on
Fossil Island
is a low-effort alternative that offers the fastest experience when not using tick manipulation. Sulliusceps are located in the
Tar Swamp
, which is in the south-western part of the island. There are six sulliusceps found throughout swamp, but only one is large enough to be chopped down at any given time, while all other locations will have sulliuscep sprouts in their location. Players must traverse the Tar Swamp to find the choppable sulliuscep, the location of which is unique to each player. Once chopped, the next sulliuscep will spawn, the location of which cycles through the same sequence over and over.
To access Fossil Island, players must have completed
Bone Voyage
. When in the swamp, players must also be able to withstand occasional attacks from
tar monsters
and
spine mushrooms
. The Spine mushrooms can also poison the player, so bringing a form of antipoison, such as an
antidote++
or the
prayer book
, is also recommended. When wearing the
Hitpoints cape
and the
regen bracelet
, very little healing is usually required. Teleporting back to your POH and using your restoration pool after chopping the final sulliuscep with the gear shown will mitigate the need to have food or Saradomin Brews in your inventory.
World 321
is the designated world for cutting sulliusceps. However, it is better to have as few players as possible when sulliuscep cutting to reduce damage taken, as Tar Monsters spawned by other players may target the player.
Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume wearing the
lumberjack outfit
. If using this method from level 65 to 99; 97,778 sulliuscep chops are needed when wearing the lumberjack outfit.

Assuming players keep the

mycelium pool
.
698
unidentified medium fossils
, 60 of which are required for the museum, leaving 638
unidentified medium fossils
for Prayer experience.
559
unidentified large fossils
, at least 50 of which are required for the museum. The player should clean fossils until at least 25 large and 25 plant fossils have been obtained. Plant fossils cannot be used in the
mycelium pool
, however
unidentified large fossils
can. Hence, the player should stop cleaning large fossils once the museum has been completed.
140
unidentified rare fossils
, which can only be used for
Prayer
experience.
Through completing the Varrock museum fossil exhibit, 120,000 experience is obtained in skills of choice. The remaining 1,329 small, 638 medium, 509 large, and 140 rare fossils may then be converted at the
mycelium pool
, calcifying them using
pyrophosphite
and
calcite
. The recalcified bones can then be used on the most eastern strange machine in the
House on the Hill
for a total of
2,416,000
Prayer experience. This amount of prayer experience would be worth
12,032,063.00
at the
Chaos altar
in the Wilderness using dragon bones. The expected average experience rate is 580,000 experience per hour for recalcifying and converting the fossils obtained from Woodcutting, which takes on average about 4 hours and 20 minutes in total.
Levels 88/89/90–99: Redwood trees
Cutting
redwood trees
in the
Woodcutting Guild
requires very little attention and offers decent experience. Players can bank the logs in the nearby bank chest. It is faster to simply drop the logs for the best experience rates. Fletching logs into stackable arrow shafts can also be convenient if the player would like to put less effort, as this does not require dropping logs. This will lower experience rates, however.
Experience rates scale depending on level. When using the infernal or the dragon axe, players can expect to gain around 55,000–60,000 experience per hour at level 90, increasing to around 65,000 experience per hour at level 99. With the
crystal axe
, players can gain up to around 70,000–75,000 experience per hour.
Similar to teak trees, redwood trees in the
Farming Guild
can be cut using 1.5t woodcutting for up to 180,000 experience per hour using a crystal axe. This is especially useful for Ironman accounts looking to bank redwood logs.
Redwoods can be cut reliably starting from level 88 using the
Dragon axe
special attack, a
Lightbearer
, and the
Preserve
prayer. Players should also wear as much prayer boosting equipment as possible to reduce the drain rate of Preserve. At level 89, Preserve is no longer required as the Lightbearer will almost always restore the player's special attack energy before their level drops back below 90 unless the special attack was activated in the last segment (12 seconds) of the
boost cycle
.
Experience rates/profit at level 99
Players may earn more experience (and its respective profit) with the felling axe/rations, Forestry/Lumberjack outfit, and other experience-boosting items.
Note:
The profit per hour for some logs is interpolated, and as such, may only be used as an approximation.

Recommended tree locations
Regular trees
These are the most abundant of all tree varieties in
Old School RuneScape
, and can be found nearly anywhere. Because regular trees only provide a single log per tree, it is recommended to find an area with multiple trees; simply use the World Map to find a suitable location that has a bank nearby. Note that dead trees and evergreen trees all count as regular trees.
Oak trees
Hosidius bank in Kourend is the closest spot for an oak tree to a bank deposit box a few tiles away.
Quite a few are found just south of the
Seers' Village
bank. This is perhaps the most convenient location due to its proximity to a bank.
Outside of the
Castle Wars
lobby, there is a large amount of oak trees that are close to bank.
Three can be found along the path between Falador park and
Falador west bank
.
Just east of the
Draynor Village
bank. Low level players should be careful here, as aggressive level 26
Jail guards
patrol the area.
Just outside the
Varrock
gates west of the west bank and east of the east bank.
Tree Gnome Stronghold
has some fairly close to its respective bank.
10 can be found along the southern Falador wall just north of the
Falador farm
, but it is quite far away from a bank compared to these other locations.
Willow trees
7 willow trees by the pond in the
Woodcutting Guild
, in addition to the guild's invisible Woodcutting boost there is a nearby
deposit box
inside
Perry's Chop-chop Shop
