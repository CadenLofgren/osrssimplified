Fastest experience
Levels 1–30: Poison karambwan
From level 1 to 30,
1-tick
cook
raw karambwan
into
poison karambwan
. Karambwan can be cooked without tick delay by holding down 1 and rapidly using raw karambwan on a fire or range. This method costs money, but the overall loss will be relatively small as reaching level 30 would take less than ten minutes.
Note that cooking
poison
karambwan does not have any requirements, unlike
cooked karambwan
.
168 successfully cooked poison karambwan are required to reach level 30. Players are advised to buy at least 500 raw karambwan, as the burn rate is high at lower levels. Assuming all 500 raw karambwan are used to reach level 30, this would result in a loss of
−193,000
. If the player is not going to use tick manipulation, it is recommended to cook other fish (see below) as this is cheaper and it would offer similar experience rates.
Levels 1–30: Cooking fish
Alternatively, cook various fish for early experience. This is slower than cooking poison karambwan, but cheaper and less click-intensive.
The fish needed for each level range are shown in the table below. Buy roughly 2.5 times more raw fish than the amount of successfully cooked fish needed, as the burn rate is fairly high at lower levels.

Levels 30–99: Cooked karambwan
Completion of the quest
Tai Bwo Wannai Trio
is required to successfully cook karambwan.
1-tick cooking karambwan.
1-tick cooking
karambwan
provides the fastest Cooking experience. Karambwan can be cooked without tick delay by holding down 1 or space and rapidly using raw karambwan on a fire or range. This requires a lot of click accuracy and can be difficult to do consistently for long periods of time. Without tick manipulation this method offers much lower experience rates and is only recommended as a cheap low-effort alternative.
Using one of the cooking locations right next to a bank offers the fastest experience rates for 1-ticking karambwan. These are located in
Rogues' Den
,
Myths' Guild
, and in the inner part of
Mor Ul Rek
. The
Hosidius kitchen
is not recommended for 1-ticking due to the increased distance to the bank, which will result in around 10–20% lower experience rates and make mistakes much more likely. Cooking gauntlets do not affect the burn rate for karambwan.
Without tick manipulation the Hosidius kitchen is the best option up to level 96. The lower burn rate outweighs the faster cooking rate of Rogues' Den when not using tick manipulation, since the longer banking time will have less effect on experience rates at a lower cooking speed compared to 1-ticking. Completing the
elite Kourend & Kebos Diary
at level 79 is recommended for further decreased burn rates. At level 96, use one of the cooking locations right next to a bank for faster experience rates.
The experience rates for 1-ticking assume using the Rogues' Den fire and cooking 5,000 karambwan per hour. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to cook up to 5,470 karambwan per hour. The AFK rates assume cooking 1,385 karambwan per hour at the Hosidius kitchen up to level 96 and 1,435 karambwan per hour in the Rogues' Den afterwards.

Levels 10–99: Bake Pie
Completion of the quest
Lunar Diplomacy
is required to cast
Bake Pie
.
Baking pies using the
Bake Pie
spell offers relatively fast experience at a low amount of effort. It also offers a decent amount of passive
Magic
experience, which can be useful for some players. This method can be fairly expensive due to the low supply of uncooked pies, and some options may not be viable due to low trading volumes.
Compared to cooking pies on a range, Bake Pie is cast at a rate of once per 3
ticks
instead of the usual 4 ticks, yielding 33.33% faster cooking speeds. An inventory of 27 pies takes 81 ticks (48.6 seconds) to cook. Additionally, the pies never burn.
The experience rates in the table below assume players bake 1,885 pies per hour, which would also give 113,100 passive Magic experience per hour. The costs assume the player is wearing a
steam battlestaff
or other items that give unlimited water and fire runes, such as a
Tome of Fire
.

Levels 35/68–99: Jug of wine
Making
jugs of wine
offers relatively fast experience. This method costs money, but it is usually fairly cheap depending on the Grand Exchange prices. It requires more attention than cooking fish or casting Bake Pie, however.
Jugs of wine are made by combining
grapes
with
jugs of water
to make
unfermented wines
, and after 12 seconds they will ferment into jugs of wine. Wines ferment in the bank, so players do not have to wait for the wines to ferment in the inventory. The 12-second timer resets each time the player makes a new jug of unfermented wine, whether banked or in the inventory, which means a large stack of wine in the bank can ferment all at once. Successfully making each jug of wine grants 200 experience.
Grapes are added to jugs of water at a rate of once per 2 ticks, which is double the rate most items are cooked on a range or fire. This, combined with the high 200 experience per jug of wine, is why wine has such fast experience rates. However, with only 14 produced per inventory, making jugs of wine requires more attention than most other cooking items, as one inventory of ingredients can be combined every 16.8 seconds, compared to the 67.2 seconds it takes to cook an entire inventory.
Players can gain up to 490,000 experience per hour from level 68 onwards. Below level 68, there is a chance for a
jug of bad wine
to be produced for 0 experience. Players using this method below level 68 should only make enough wines to get to their next cooking level to be as efficient as possible due to the chances of successfully creating wines increasing with every level gained.

Levels 30–99: Cooking fish
Cooking various fish is a cheap or profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. Cooking an inventory of fish takes around 1 minute and 14 seconds in the Hosidius Kitchen, including banking.
The
cooking gauntlets
from the
Family Crest
quest reduce the burn rate for
lobsters
,
swordfish
,
monkfish
,
sharks
, and
anglerfish
when worn. Having the gauntlets is required for optimal rates when cooking these fish. Expect much lower rates without the gauntlets.
Completing the
easy Kourend & Kebos Diary
grants access to the cooking ranges in the
Hosidius Kitchen
. They provide a 5% increased chance of successfully cooking food over standard cooking ranges. This is increased to 10% after completing the
elite Kourend & Kebos Diary
, which requires level 84 Cooking (boostable). Cooking fish in the Hosidius Kitchen offers comparable or slightly higher experience rates than at the ranges in
Myths' Guild
or
Mor Ul Rek
because of the increased cooked rate, despite the ranges being slightly further away from a bank. The Hosidius ranges remain comparable or better until level 93, after which it becomes faster to cook anglerfish on a normal range.
The fish and experience needed for each level range are shown in the table below. The experience rates assume 1,365 fish cooked per hour in the Hosidius Kitchen, or 1,435 fish cooked per hour in Myths' Guild or Mor Ul Rek. The rates assume wearing the cooking gauntlets (where applicable) and using the Hosidius kitchen unless noted otherwise. Cooking in the Hosidius kitchens assumes completion of the elite
Kourend & Kebos Diary
from level 79 Cooking onwards (with a +5 boost to level 84). Experience and profit rates take the burn rates into account. The actual amounts of raw fish needed can vary depending on luck, so slightly more or less fish may be needed. Swordfish and monkfish offer very similar rates for levels 68–80, so choose whichever is more profitable.

Choosing Cooking locations
Cooking most foods takes four
game ticks
, and 28 can be cooked per inventory. Therefore, a full inventory takes 112 ticks or 67.2 seconds, making Cooking one of the least attentive skills in the game.
Assuming no banking and no food burned, a player could theoretically cook up to 1,500 raw foods per hour; however, factoring in bank-time, players can expect to cook between 1,300 and 1,400. The following table compares the different cooking locations by their bank proximity and corresponding items cooked per hour. The table assumes the bank distance is ran, no food is burnt, and that banking takes 3 seconds (5 ticks).

The fire is everlasting, so there is no need to worry about relighting it, saving inventory space. On the downside, Rogues' Den only has a fire as the means to cook, so it is only usable for cooking fish or meat, and it does not offer the benefit of reduced burning on a range.

Quest. This location is not recommended at higher levels when food is no longer burned, but may save time at earlier levels, as trips take longer but more food is successfully cooked. It's slightly faster to stand east of the ladder before going up so you don't run around the ladder. See
Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)
for which foods.
Ground floor of the
Lumbridge Castle

*Running takes 0.5 ticks per square. A bank 4 tiles away will require you to traverse 8 tiles (there and back), so crossing 8 tiles at 2 tiles per tick will take 4 ticks.
