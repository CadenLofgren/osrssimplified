Free-to-play melee training
Melee training
This article is about the free-to-play guide. For the members' guide, see
Pay-to-play melee training
.
This article provides information about effective ways to train
Attack
,
Strength
,
Defence
, and
Hitpoints
through
melee
combat
in free-to-play.
This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level, but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food, or use food that heals more.

Equipment choice
Players should always use the best
scimitar
they can equip as scimitars offer the highest damage per second of any other type of free-to-play melee weapon due to their high speed and high strength bonus. Use the
amulet of strength
if it gives a higher max hit for your
Strength
level, otherwise use the
amulet of power
for more accuracy, defence, and especially if it provides the same maximum damage as the amulet of strength at certain Strength levels with certain attack styles. Use full
melee armour
sets against monsters that use
melee
, and
ranged armour
against monsters that use
magic
. A
chainbody
is more useful than a
platebody
against monsters that use crush.
As for boots, you may start off with
fancy boots
or
fighting boots
(both have same stats as members'
bronze boots
) that are awarded in the
Stronghold of Security
, or
leather boots
if you don't want to reclaim the stronghold boots when you die. The best-in-slot boots for melee combat is
decorative boots (gold)
for its melee defence and its +1 Strength bonus (same stats as members'
adamant boots
). However, the time it takes to obtain gold decorative boots (400
castle wars tickets
) is not worth the time spent to train melee skills to 99 but if you quickly want more defence bonus over fancy or fighting boots to tank more hits,
decorative boots (red)
(same stats as members'
steel boots
) is a decent defence upgrade with +4 more defence bonus than fancy/fighting boots that can easily be obtained within a few
Castle Wars
matches (4 castle wars tickets) and with a bit more time put into Castle Wars,
decorative boots (white)
(same stats as members'
mithril boots
, 40 castle wars tickets) is a good defence upgrade with +3 more defence bonuses than red boots if you don't wish to spend a lot of time going for decorative boots (gold) for the gold boots' +1 Strength Bonus.
As for capes, all coloured
capes
,
team capes
, and the
cabbage cape
share the same defence bonus and are best-in-slot for free-to-play players. For gloves,
gilded d'hide vambraces
are best-in-slot but require 40
Ranged
to equip and may be prohibitively expensive for some players. A cheaper alternative is
green d'hide vambraces
, otherwise the next best choice is
leather vambraces
or
leather
/
coloured gloves
depending on enemy attack style until 40 Ranged is achieved.

Gold decorative armour
pieces (besides the legs) are more effective to run in than their adamant counterparts as they weigh less.
Decorative armour (gold platelegs)
weighs the same as an
adamant plateskirt
but weighs less than
adamant platelegs
.
^
Holy symbol
provide no offensive bonuses but it provides a +8
Prayer bonus
that is useful for using
prayers
for a longer period of time.
^
The barronite mace is the best weapon to use against
runecrafting
golems
in the
Ruins of Camdozaal
, even better than the rune scimitar, due to its golembane effect. Otherwise this is the second best weapon against anything else.
^
Leather gloves have greater crush defence than leather vambraces, equal to that of green d'hide vambraces.
^
Decorative boots (gold)
provide a +1 Strength bonus, equivalent to the
adamant boots
. It is the only piece of melee armour in free-to-play that provide a
Strength bonus
. No other pieces of free-to-play melee armour provide Strength or attack bonuses.
Maximum hit
See also:
Maximum melee hit
Rune scimitars
offer the best damage per second (DPS) in free-to-play and is recommended to use for melee training from Level 40
Attack
and all melee skill onwards so it is recommended to achieve Level 40 Attack as soon as possible. Training Attack slightly increases the attack accuracy of your hits. However, training Strength is important for increasing maximum damage which also increases damage per second.
To further increase damage per second, there are three free-to-play
neck slot
items that can provide attack and/or strength bonuses including
amulet of accuracy
,
amulet of power
, and
amulet of strength
. If the player cannot afford an amulet of power or if an
ironman
cannot acquire an amulet of strength (
50
to craft a
ruby amulet
and
49
for
Lvl-3 Enchant
) or an amulet of power (
70
to craft a
diamond amulet
and
57
for
Lvl-4 Enchant
), the amulet of accuracy from
Imp Catcher
is a weaker alternative to the amulet of power (without a strength bonus) until the player can acquire one of the other two amulets.
The skill to train first depends on the player's preference and a preferential example could be to keep melee skills (and Defence) within five or ten levels of each other while prioritising one combat skill over the others. If the player wants to deal the most damage first, the player would prioritise training Strength until they achieve a new maximum hit for a different attack style to train the next combat skill with the amulet of power.
Strength levels 1 to 99
The following tables below will determine the maximum of damage certain weapons can inflict on enemies at certain attack styles with the following amulets at certain Strength levels so that you can determine which enchanted amulet you should use at certain Strength levels. The
aggressive attack style
adds an invisible +3 Strength level boost, the amulet of power adds a +6 Melee Strength bonus, and the amulet of strength adds a +10 Melee Strength bonus. Amulet of accuracy is not included in the table since it does not provide a strength bonus, and even though
gold decorative boots
from
Castle Wars
provide a Melee Strength bonus of +1 with higher defence bonuses than
fighting boots
/
fancy boots
, the amount of time it takes to acquire the boots (over 40 hours if winning Castle Wars every time to 400
castle wars tickets
) is not worth the time to train Attack, Strength, and Defence to 99 and so the tables will not account for gold decorative boots' bonus.
Strength levels higher than 99 are strength
boosts
from the use of
beer
or
strength potion
. At level 99 Strength, a strength potion will temporarily boost strength up to 111.

Barronite mace
Free-to-play
ironmen
can only acquire a rune scimitar through
smithing
at level 90 Smithing (or level 89 Smithing with a
dwarven stout
). Until then, the second best option for free-to-play ironmen to effectively train melee combat is
barronite mace
, which can be obtained by exchanging a
barronite guard
,
barronite handle
,
barronite head
, and 1,500
barronite shards
to
Ramarno
in the
Ruins of Camdozaal
after the completion of
Below Ice Mountain
.

Rune sword
The third best option would be the
rune sword
, or alternatively the
rune mace
at certain Strength levels depending on which amulet you use, both of which can be bought from the
Champions' Guild
. While
rune longswords
are stronger and more accurate than rune swords and rune maces, it is slower, resulting in a lower damage per second. Rune swords provide the third best melee damage per second in free-to-play and are good for
ironmen
to train with until a barronite mace or rune scimitar is obtained.
The maximum hit table below is for the rune sword.

Advantages
Disadvantages
Always aggressive towards players of all levels, making this a great afk training method at any level to 99 and beyond.
After aggression ends in 10 minutes, if the player is training among the giant spiders just north of the ladder upon entering the first room of giant spiders from the ladder, players can re-aggro them by running to the end of the corners of the room of giant spiders: Top-left corner of the room after the first 10 minutes, then top-right corner of the room after the next 10 minutes, then bottom-right corner of the room after the next 10 minutes, repeat. If this doesn't seem to work (as in if aggressive areas covers the entire room, usually due to
random events
teleporting the player), climbing up the ladder and climbing back down will reset aggression too.
Giant spiders can sometimes hit up to a maximum of 7 points of damage.
No drops other than
beginner clue scrolls
.
Unattended players could still possibly die before aggression ends. This happens less often at higher Defence but it's still possible.
Hardcore ironmen, pay attention to your character at all times!

Ignoring drops, this is also an afk training method.
Common hotspot for
player killers
. If you wish to bank your expensive drops, don't stay long.
If you don't plan on picking up drops, there is nothing much to worry about if you have

first
.
To continue training on greater demons, if your

point is in
Lumbridge
(
Edgeville
respawn is recommended), run across
River Lum
and up towards the farm house, grab a
bronze axe
, run back south towards the Lumbridge
Canoe Station
, and travel to the Wilderness (57

Alternative accounts in Clan Wars
If you have a
1 Defence combat pure
and high Hitpoints (80+ HP for example), stock them up with
jugs of wine
and attack them in the Free-For-All
Clan Wars
portal. This is the fastest combat training method in free-to-play when done efficiently. This training method is not recommended for players who have not yet made a one-Defence combat pure account and it wouldn't be worth the time training one up just for this training method alone. But it is recommended for alternate accounts created after a high HP one-Defence combat pure account.
Alternatively,
wizard's mind bombs
can reduce a character's Defence towards 0 Defence but Defence will regenerate by a point every 60 seconds.
Alternative accounts in Castle Wars
Thanks to the
castle wars bracelet
and
castlewars brew
, the
Castle Wars
minigame provides considerable combat bonuses in comparison to the
Clan Wars
minigame. By attacking a
1 Defence combat pure
holding a captured flag, you can achieve the highest
maximum melee hits
in
free-to-play
worlds. The alternative account can be healed with
bandages
without the need to bring any supplies. To make the healing more effective, wear a
castle wars bracelet
. Note that the healing scales with the
Hitpoints
level, so to maximise the effect the account needs at least 90 level.
