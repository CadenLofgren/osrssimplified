There are several ways to train
Fishing
in
free-to-play
. Depending on the desired goals of the player, they can choose between methods favouring experience rates or profit. If you choose to go with making a profit, be sure to sell your catch at the
Grand Exchange
and not a General store in order to maximize your profits. Keep in mind, since the
Grand Exchange
acts as an in-game stock market, that means the prices are always changing. You can find the latest prices on the

Methods with the highest experience rates
Levels 1–20 – Raw shrimps and raw anchovies
Fishing
raw shrimps
and
raw anchovies
with a
small fishing net
at a
net fishing
location is the fastest way to train fishing at level 1 with experience rates of 1,500–3,000 experience per hour. The
small net fishing spot
is the only possible fishing location at level 1. Players must reach level 15 Fishing before there is a chance for them to receive a raw anchovy while fishing, which will increase their experience rates to around 7,500 experience per hour. To achieve the most optimal experience rates, players would want to drop the caught fish, instead of banking. Alternatively, the raw fish can be cooked for small amounts of
Cooking
experience. If planning on banking the fish, players should fish at
Al Kharid
, due to its proximity to a bank, however there is an aggressive level 14
scorpion
that occasionally wanders near the southern fishing spots. Another spot to bank the fish is south of the bank in
Draynor Village
, next to the willow trees, though beware of aggressive level 7
Dark Wizards
. For players that don't want to have to deal with combat, and want to sell the fish, the fishing spot South-West of
Port Sarim
is ideal as it is a somewhat short run away from
Gerrant's Fishy Business.
Alternative for levels 5–20 – raw sardines and raw herring
Fishing
raw sardine
and
raw herring
with a
fishing rod
and
bait
at a
bait fishing
location is the fastest way to train fishing until level 20 with experience rate of 3,000-8,000 experience per hour (when herring is unlocked it is 8,000). The
small net fishing spot
is the ideal place to fish. Players who reach level 20 fishing can move to fishing
trout
for faster experience per hour.
Levels 20–40/99 – Raw trout and raw salmon
Fishing
raw trout
and
raw salmon
with a
fly fishing rod
at a
fly fishing
location and dropping it offers the fastest way to train Fishing to 99 as a free-to-play. At level 20, players can expect to achieve around ~15k Fishing XP/hour while dropfishing. Players must reach level 30 Fishing before there is a chance for them to receive a raw salmon while fishing, which will increase their experience rates to ~33k Fishing XP/hour while dropfishing at higher Fishing levels. Fly fishing can be done in
Lumbridge
, and
Barbarian Village
, and consumes a
feather
per every fish caught. Around 600 feathers would be consumed from levels 20–40, and 225,000 feathers from 20–99.
At the expense of experience per hour, players can cook their raw fish on the permanent fire in
Barbarian Village
next to the fishing spot, providing them with Cooking experience and a food source if players choose to bank the cooked fish.
Method #1: Fly fish at Barbarian Village, cook at Barbarian Village permanent fire, bank cooked fish at Ferox Enclave (57 Woodcutting needed for waka canoe, canoe from Barbarian Village to Ferox Enclave for banking, and canoe back to Barbarian Village to fish): ~18 k Fishing XP/hour & ~24 k Cooking XP/hour
Method #2: Fly fish at Barbarian Village, bank raw fish at Ferox Enclave (57 Woodcutting needed for waka canoe, canoe from Barbarian Village to Ferox Enclave for banking, and canoe back to Barbarian Village to fish): ~26 k Fishing XP/hour
Method #3: Fly fish at Barbarian Village, cook at Barbarian Village permanent fire, drop cooked fish: ~23.5 k Fishing XP/hour & ~31 k Cooking XP/hour.
Alternatively, players can bring an axe and tinderbox to Lumbridge, chop some logs near the fishing spot and make a fire at the fishing spot. They can use the fire to cook the fish directly after catching them (and then click the spot to continue fishing). The cooked fish could be used for
tick manipulation
by eating them, resulting in significantly higher experience rates (~80k Fishing XP/hour) at the cost of increased intensity.
Profitable methods
Levels 15–39 – Raw shrimps/anchovies
Raw shrimps
are sold for
73
.
Raw anchovies
are sold for
22
. Drop the cheaper fish you catch, banking only the other. 
Expect to catch between 150 and 280 fish an hour between levels 15 and 39.
Catching 150-280 shrimp an hour has a profit range of
10,950
to
20,440
.
Catching 150-280 anchovies an hour has a profit range of
3,300
to
6,160
.
The best place to catch them is
Draynor Village
, but if under
combat level
15 one of the
Dark wizards
may attack.
Levels 40–49 – Raw lobster
For the full guide on catching lobsters, see
here
.
Fish
raw lobsters
at
Musa Point
. Players can expect to make
20,440
and 12,600 Fishing experience per hour. To bank the caught raw lobsters, use the boat to travel to
Port Sarim
, costing 30 coins  one way. In Port Sarim, walk to the docks with the monks and use the
bank deposit
to deposit the raw lobsters. If you have completed both
The Corsair Curse
and
Dragon Slayer I
, you can also use the
Corsair Cove Resource Area
to avoid paying the fare back and forth to use the deposit box.
Levels 50–99 – Raw tuna/swordfish
For the full guide on catching tuna/swordfish, see
here
.
Fish at the
harpoon spot
at
Musa Point
. Players can expect to make
19,149
and 17,160 Fishing experience per hour.
Alternatives:
More clicks: Drop the
raw swordfish
(
118
each), since they are worth a lot less than
raw tuna
(
85
each).
Less walking and coins, more experience per hour: Sell fish at the
Karamja General Store
.
More total experience and clicks, less walking and coins: Cook the fish after caught.
An
axe
can be wielded to save an inventory slot.
Logs can be obtained from trees near the charter ship.
A
tinderbox
can be brought or purchased at the Karamja General Store for 1 coin.
Depending on the amount, trading burnt fish at the Karamja General Store (0 coins) can be quicker than dropping them one at a time.
Other methods
Levels 7/20/33–99 – Ruins of Camdozaal
After the completion of
Below Ice Mountain
, players can fish in the
Ruins of Camdozaal
. This is generally slower to train Fishing than fishing for trout and salmon (even when dropping Camdozaal fish) but this method will also help train both
Cooking
and
Prayer
. In other words, this training method is only recommended if you plan on training Prayer.
It requires 7
Fishing
and 7
Cooking
to fish and prepare
guppy
.  Having 33 Fishing and 33 Cooking are needed to fish and prepare
tetra
, which provide the most prayer experience among the free-to-play fish. Tetra stop ruining at Cooking level 61. However, players can stop ruining tetra around level 54 Cooking if they purchase the
Preparation buff
from
Ramarno's Shard Exchange
for 2500
Barronite shards
. Purchasing the
Fishing
and
Preparation
buffs from
Ramarno
's
shard exchange
slightly increases the experience rates for lower Fishing and Cooking levels respectively.
Use a
small fishing net
to catch fish in the
fishing spot
nearby. A small fishing net is provided in the space north of the preparation table and altar.
Prepare these fish at the
preparation table
using a
knife
. You'll gain Cooking experience. A knife lies on the floor nearby the table.
Offer the prepared fish at the altar for Prayer experience.
Experience rates per hour are 5,600 Fishing, 7,400 Cooking, and 2,400 Prayer or less when offering all fish types (only possible at Level 61+ cooking, when tetra stop ruining) with decent efficiency.
