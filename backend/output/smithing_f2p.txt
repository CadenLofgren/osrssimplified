This

outlines the best methods for training the
Smithing
skill
in
free-to-play
. There are a few ways to profit with Smithing in free-to-play, such as smelting
bars
or making
rune equipment
, however it is more beneficial to simply perform the fastest experience methods and use the saved time to make money from alternative methods.

General Advice

When making equipment with
bars
, experience gained is based off the number of bars used, therefore using larger amounts of bars at once yields the highest experience rates. This means smithing
platebodies
when available is always the fastest experience per tier of bar. The best place to smith bars is the
anvil
south of
Varrock west bank
, as it is the closest anvil to a bank in free-to-play.
Energy potions
(
187
) can optionally be brought in the two empty inventory spaces when making platebodies to continuously sprint with level 1
Agility
, at an added cost of roughly
1.44
per bar (1 energy potion dose per 32.5 bars). Depending on starting
gp
and profit from making certain platebodies, one can gain much more gold per hour as well as experience per hour using energy potions instead of letting run energy recharge naturally by walking.
An option available to players with 55
Magic
is to cast
High Level Alchemy
on their created platebodies to either reduce costs, increase profits, or gain
Magic
experience. If choosing to alch their platebodies, then it is possible to alch 1-2 platebodies
efficiently
as a
zero time
Magic
training method on the run from the anvil back to the bank. For this, one should equip a
staff of fire
and bring
nature runes
in place of one of their energy potions while smithing. Otherwise, the platebodies can be alched later, on their own or during other activities such as
combat
.
Level 1-29: The Knight's Sword
It is highly recommended to complete
The Knight's Sword
quest
immediately for the reward of 12,725
Smithing
experience, enough to level Smithing from 1 to 29.

Smith
bronze platebodies
from level 18 (or 29 if
The Knight's Sword
has been completed) to 33 for 5 bars and 62.5 experience each. Smithing
bronze platebodies
at the anvil south of
Varrock west bank
gives experience rates of 50,000 Smithing XP per hour constantly running. Since bronze platebodies are smithed from 5 bars each,

Level 87/88-98: Adamant platebodies
Smith
adamant platebodies
from levels 88 to 98 for 312.5 experience each. Alternatively, from level 87 Smithing players can also boost to 88 for adamant platebodies with
dwarven stout
. Adamant platebodies give up to 250,000 experience per hour with the use of
energy potions
. Smithing
adamant platebodies
from levels 87/88 to 98/99 may take upwards of 35-45 hours depending on efficiency and use of
energy potions
.
Note: The next section for
rune platebodies
is helpful and slightly faster experience per hour. However, most players will opt to continue smithing
adamant platebodies
all the way to level 99 even though
rune platebodies
are more experience per item, as adamant platebodies may be cheaper experience per gold spent for comparable XP rates.

rune platebodies

dwarven stout
for a +1 Smithing boost for one minute. Maintain
energy
with
energy potions
. This will give experience rates of up to 300,000 Smithing experience per hour. However,
rune platebodies
can be extremely expensive despite offering the highest experience gained per hour for free-to-play Smithing training.

Level 20-88: Smelting and Crafting
Crafting
gold jewellry
(and
silver jewellry
) is a
potentially profitable
way to train
Crafting
. If you're already making jewellry, you can use
gold ore
(or
silver ore
) to first make a
gold bar
(or
silver bar
). While this is a significantly slower overall method of training smithing, the marginal time cost of smelting is simply the smelting itself (because you already have to make trips between the bank and furnace anyway). Your effective marginal smelting rate is 1200 bars an hour (one bar every 5
ticks
); or potentially even more, as the increased time per bank trip allows
run energy
to recover sustainably.

Level 70-99: Superheat Item
Players with level
43
can cast
superheat item
, which can smelt a bar from anywhere at its normal ore cost, plus 1
nature rune
and 4
fire runes
(no fire runes are necessary with a
staff of fire
equipped). This saves time travelling between the furnace and bank. Also, it only has a
3 tick
cast time (1.8 seconds) rather than the standard 5 ticks (3 seconds) it takes to smelt a bar in a furnace. As such, it can process more bars per hour, earning Magic experience in addition to the normal Smithing xp. As a bonus, it successfully smelts
iron bars
100% of the time, without needing a
ring of forging
.
One disadvantage of superheat item is that it does not auto-cast if you have the supplies to make multiple bars; it must be cast on each ore in the inventory, making this method more click intensive.
While this method is still considerably slower at gaining experience than the
fastest experience
mentioned above, it can be more cost effective.

Level 98-99: Smithing Rune Equipment
Using a
dwarven stout
, players can boost from 98 to 99 Smithing and smith
rune platelegs
,
rune plateskirts
, and
rune 2h swords
as a
potentially profitable
alternative to adamant/rune platebodies. One
dwarven stout
must be drank every minute to maintain 99 Smithing from 98; this adds a cost of approximately one
dwarven stout
per 45
runite bars
, or roughly
3.11
per bar. Currently, the most profitable 3 bar rune item to smith when selling on the
Grand Exchange
is
Rune plateskirt
. If casting High Level Alchemy after smithing, it does not matter whether
rune platelegs
,
rune plateskirts
, or
rune 2h swords
are made, as they have the same High Level Alchemy value.
Experience rates of approximately 215,000 Smithing experience per hour can be obtained from equipment made with 3
runite bars
.

AFK Methods
Level 1-99: Smelting Bars
As stated at the start of this guide, if you are just looking to make money or train smithing as fast as possible, it is usually better to train smithing using the faster methods above and use the time saved on faster money makers. However, smelting bars can be a good method for players looking for an AFK method that also generates a profit. Be sure to check the GE before making any bars to make sure you will be making a profit instead of a loss. To use this method, it is recommended that you bank a large number of ores ahead of time: either by purchasing them from the GE, or mining them yourself if you don't have any gold or want the mining experience. Then head to the
Edgeville Furnace
as it is the closest furnace to a bank in free-to-play.

Level 14+: Barronite Deposits
With 14
Mining
and 14
Smithing
,
barronite deposits
can be mined from
barronite rocks
in the
Camdozaal Mines
after completing the
quest
Below Ice Mountain
. Using them on the special
barronite crusher
anvil near
Ramarno
with a
hammer
yields various rewards, including
barronite shards
and 30 Smithing experience. This method generates very slow smithing experience since the deposits are untradeable and must be mined before crushing. If you are also trying to AFK train Mining in Camdozaal, crushing deposits can be a good way to generate some additional Smithing experience, otherwise it is better to use any of the other methods in this guide. Since Smithing experience is directly tied to how quickly barronite deposits can be mined, a higher Mining level will lead to higher Smithing experience rates.
If using this method, the best technique is to keep a hammer and the highest tier pickaxe you can in your inventory and mine the barronite rocks until your inventory is full. If you have a high enough
Attack
level, wielding your pickaxe will give you an extra inventory slot for a deposit, however it is better to carry a higher tier pickaxe in your inventory than wielding a lower tier one. Once your inventory is full of deposits, head to the barronite crusher and crush all of the deposits for Smithing experience. You can drop any items you get from the deposits, or bank them at the
bank chest
east of Ramarno; however, since barronite shards stack, it is easiest just to leave them in your inventory for the entire session and use them to purchase
buffs
from Ramarno. The
