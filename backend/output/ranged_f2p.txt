The
gilded dragonhide armour
set (excluding the
gilded coif
) can be used and purchased from the
Grand Exchange
in free-to-play but at a hefty price, otherwise the player will have to complete
elite
or
master clue scrolls
in Members. They are the only free-to-play dragonhide armour set that were not affected by the
equipment rebalance
update that has the original stats of
green dragonhide armour
, making gilded dragonhide armour the best-in-slot for its defences, but they have the same ranged attack bonuses as green dragonhide armour. It's recommended if the player trains in the open tanking attacks. If safespotting enemies, gilded dragonhide armour is not necessary and green dragonhide armour works just as well.
Ammunition slot
The below chart for prices should be consulted before purchasing large quantities of arrows. Note that moving up from one tier of arrows to the next will increase max hit by 0-2 damage each. For example, at level 40 Ranged with the rapid attack style, when moving from iron arrows to steel or mithril arrows your max hit will stay at 6 damage and therefore all three will function identically; however, when moving from mithril to adamant, your max hit will increase by 1 to a total of 7 damage, increasing your rate of experience per hour by 16.6%. If you decide to pick up ammo, enable Ammo-picking behaviour in the
Gameplay settings
in order to automatically equip ammo you pick up if it is already equipped in your ammo slot.

Attack styles
Accurate
The accurate style of attack gives an invisible +3 Ranged level boost, increasing accuracy and, at certain combinations of Ranged level and arrow type, increasing your max hit by 1.
Rapid
The rapid attack style increases your attack speed by 1 tick (attacks come out 0.6 seconds faster).
Longrange
The longrange attack style gives an invisible +3
Defence
level boost and increases your attack range by 2 squares (up to 10). All normal Ranged experience that would be gained is split 50/50 between Ranged and Defence.
Which to use
Until your max hit with the rapid attack style is 2, the accurate style is better than rapid when the +3 Ranged bonus increases your max hit with the arrows you are using. However, this is only the case at levels 3-5 (bronze arrows) or 2-4 (iron arrows or bronze bolts). After level 5, rapid becomes better damage per second than accurate for all levels beyond, as +1 max hit damage becomes less and less good in terms of the percentage of damage it contributes to your damage per second compared to the flat 33.3% percent increase from using rapid.
It is not recommended to use longrange for training, since money is spent on arrows when training Defence through Ranged; it's usually cheaper (as well as faster) to train Defence through melee combat instead.
Maximum hit
The maximum hit for free-to-play Ranged is dependent on three factors: Ranged level, arrow type, and whether or not ranged prayer bonus is activated. Note that any other equipment such as bow quality has no direct effect on max hit, it just allows you to use better arrows (though better bows do increase accuracy and therefore damage per second). When there is overlap in maximum hit between the various arrows, it is best to use the cheapest one. For example, at Ranged level 24 a
bronze arrow
is identical to a
mithril arrow
in terms of damage output, therefore it is recommended to train using the cheaper bronze arrow. Your maximum hit may also increase due to your shooting style. The
accurate
style grants +3 to your Ranged level, the
rapid
style grants +0, and the
long range
style also grants +0.

Bronze bolts
have the same maximum hit as iron arrows for any given Ranged level.
Monsters for training
Beginner-level monsters
Seagulls, cows, goblins, and chickens (combat levels vary)
From
Ranged
levels 1–20,
seagulls
,
cows
,
goblins
, and
chickens
provide the best possible experience with their extremely low
Defence
level of 1 and negative Ranged Defence stats. The highest experience rates are achieved at, in order, level 3 seagulls, level 2 seagulls, cows, level 2 goblins, and chickens. Level 3 seagulls are the fastest experience because of their -42 Ranged Defence and large pool of 10 Hitpoints, and will almost never do damage to the player; they can be found either at
Port Sarim
or at
Corsair Cove
. Level 2 seagulls have the same low Defence stats, but only have 6 Hitpoints instead of 10. The other monsters, cows, goblins, and chickens, can all be found in the area to the east and north of
Lumbridge Castle
. Cows can be safespotted across the fences enclosing them, making them also completely safe to train against.
Monks (combat level 5)
Monks
are a good alternative to the above monsters as they have slightly higher
Defence
, but also have 15 hitpoints, do almost no damage, and heal you for free when you talk to them. Monks are slightly slower experience than
barbarians
but safer to train at. You can find them in the
Edgeville Monastery
(north-west of
Barbarian Village
). Even at higher levels, this is still a good place to train. The only cons are that many people train here and it's hard to find a non-crowded world.
Low-level monsters
Barbarians (combat levels 10, 15, and 17)
From
Ranged
levels 21–25
Barbarians
at
Barbarian Village
are a good inbetween monster for seagulls and giant frogs, as the level 10 barbarians have a slightly lower Hitpoints level of 18 compared to giant frogs' 23 but also have a lower Defence of 3. Since they have the same Defence as monks but higher Hitpoints, they are faster experience than monks, however they are also slightly more dangerous and will not heal you for free.  You are able to safespot these Barbarians with the rocks and torch near the western exit of the village. There are also level 15 and 17 barbarians and a unique barbarian named
Gunthor the brave
in the long hall at the northern end of the village along with a food spawn on the table. These barbarians can be safespot over the table, however they have higher Defence and are therefore not as good experience as giant frogs, especially Gunthor who has similar Defence to a
moss giant
. Note that there is a fishing spot near the Barbarian village - many people will drop their Salmon & Trout from there, which you can cook for food.
Giant frogs (combat level 13)
From
Ranged
levels 26–56,
giant frogs
are the fastest experience, with their high 23 Hitpoints and low 6 Defence. They can be found in the
Lumbridge Swamp
, just south of
Lumbridge Castle
. They only drop
big bones
, which can be buried for
Prayer
experience. Banking the bones is not recommended as
wizards
provide better income.
Optionally, players can bring any
axe
and a
tinderbox
to kill nearby
Giant Rats
for their meat, which can then be cooked by cutting down nearby
dead trees
.
Wizards (combat level 9) or dark wizards (combat levels 7 or 20)
For players with 20+
Ranged
, the two
dark wizards
in
Draynor Village
, found among the
willow trees
near the bank, provide good Ranged training as their magic is often blocked by
studded armour
. Nearby is the
Wizards' Tower
, which is home to many level 9
wizards
, who give the best combination of loot and experience for
Ranged
levels between 9 and 69 (inclusive).
Players with a combat level of 41+ and 30
Ranged
can start fighting wizards at
Delrith
's circle south of
Varrock
as they drop even more
runes
(along with being one of the highest likelihood sources for
beginner clue scrolls
) and are in greater number giving less likelihood of training overcrowding from other players.
Wizards drop copious amounts of runes which can be sold to other players or
magic shops
or can be later used for
Magic
training. They are noted for their higher level rune drops, such as
nature runes
.
Players are, however, advised to have a good supply of food against wizards as the level 7 ones can have a maximum hit of 4 and the level 20 dark wizards can hit up to 6, and frequently do.
One of the main advantages of training Ranged on wizards is that because they use a magic attack they stay where they are to attack. This means that when a player collects their
arrows
they will be all in the same spot. Melee targets will try to get as close as possible and will move, causing arrows to be scattered.
Minotaurs (combat levels 12 or 27)
Minotaurs
found in the
Stronghold of Security
have a much higher
Defence
level than
giant frogs
and have less hitpoints, making them a poor place to train. The primary benefit of training on minotaurs is that they commonly drop iron arrows, allowing for cheap training for players who cannot afford to buy large amounts of arrows for themselves.
Mid-level monsters
Moss giants (combat level 42)
From
Ranged
levels 57–99,
moss giants
provide the highest possible experience. They have higher defences than
giant frogs
and
Flesh Crawlers
, but also have 60 Hitpoints, one of the largest health pools in free-to-play. However, after around level 57
Ranged
you will almost never miss, allowing you to take full advantage of their large pool of health to achieve the highest possible experience rates. Moss giants also have decent drops, most notably
big bones
and the unique
mossy key
which is used to access
Bryophyta
and open
Bryophyta's chest
.
In free-to-play, they can be found in the innermost part of the
Varrock Sewers
,
Crandor
, and the
Wilderness
. In the Varrock Sewers, there are two separate groups of giants at the end of the sewer, both of which are safespottable. On Crandor there are several which spawn on the south side of the island which can also be safespotted. It may be advisable to train on Crandor mainly due to the fact that there are more spawns. Both locations tend to be crowded from melee and ranged training, but Crandor is a
single-way combat
area. This means another player cannot deal more damage than you on that monster and therefore steal your drop. The Wilderness is a good place to kill moss giants only for players wishing to collect
mossy keys
, as the moss giants there have an increased chance of dropping keys but have no safespots.
Rangers new to training on moss giants are advised to train in Varrock Sewers, bringing a slash weapon or knife required to slash the web to get in, a set of runes to cast
Varrock Teleport
to quickly escape, and the rest of the inventory filled with cheap food such as
jugs of wine
. Since the area is multicombat, for the first 10 minutes it is easy for players with a low
Defence
level to take a lot of damage quickly before the moss giants become
tolerant
, especially when collecting drops, which is why at least some food is recommended.
Observed experience rates at ranged level 72 is around 35,000-37,000 xp per hour, using optimal equipment with adamant arrows and not collecting drops or arrows.
Flesh Crawlers (combat levels 28, 35 or 41)
Flesh Crawlers
in the
Stronghold of Security
have similar defensive stats and give similar experience rates to
giant frogs
, but are aggressive to players of any level, allowing for afk training for 10 minute periods at a time before they become
tolerant
. When the Flesh Crawlers are no longer aggressive, players can run a short distance away and back which will reset their aggression for another 10 minutes.
As Flesh Crawlers can quickly and repeatedly hit 1s, it's best to start training against them with around 40–60+
Defence
. For food, you can either bring
jugs of wine
from the bank, teleporting to
Barbarian Village
with a charged
skull sceptre (i)
and back to the bank with runes when you run out, or you can bring
feathers
and a
fly fishing rod
and catch and cook
trout
and
salmon
for food just outside Barbarian Village. As an additional bonus, Flesh Crawlers also drop uncut
gems
and
bottom of sceptres
, the latter of which can be
chiseled
into stackable
bone fragments
(
707
) to sell on the Grand Exchange.
If afk training here on a world that already has at least one player, standing on the same
tile
as the player(s) that are currently training reduces the chances of the Flesh Crawlers bunching up in a way which causes them to be unable to attack the player, vastly increasing xp rates.
Giant spiders (combat level 50)
Also in the
Stronghold of Security
, level 50
giant spiders
act as an aggressive, afk alternative to
moss giants
, with very similar Defence but only 50 Hitpoints instead of 60, providing a bit slower experience rates. If players want to train here in Ranged gear and achieve good experience rates, a
Defence
level of 80 or higher is recommended along with good food such as
jugs of wine
, as giant spiders are dangerous and can hit up to 7 fairly accurately, especially against Ranged gear. Giant spiders stop being aggressive after 10 minutes; this can be reset by running a short distance away and coming back. Giant spiders have no drops.
Hill giants (combat level 28)
Hill giants
have similar
Defence
to
moss giants
but have almost half the Hit points, making them slower experience. However, hill giants have better drops than moss giants, both drop
big bones
(
292
) but hill giants also additionally drop
limpwurt roots
(
316
),
nature runes
(
105
), and
body talismans
(
1,681
). Hill giants are also desirable for their unique
giant key
drop, which is the only way to access
Obor
. They can be fought in the
Edgeville Dungeon
near the Grand Exchange with a safespot, the
Giants' Plateau
near
Al Kharid
with a safespot, or in the
Wilderness
at two different locations, with no safespots. The Wilderness hill giants are risky and are only recommended for players who want to acquire
giant keys
more quickly, since they drop them more frequently; however, since there are only a few hill giants at both spots in the Wilderness, without world hopping it's faster for keys and experience to simply kill the ones in the Edgeville Dungeon or Giants' Plateau instead.
High-level monsters
Ogresses (combat level 82)
Ogresses
are slower than
ankou
and
lesser demons
when it comes to Ranged training due to their higher defences but they profit better when being fought at high-level
Ranged
. They are commonly trained on for profit by high-level free players.
Ogress Warriors
and
Ogress Shamans
can be fought and
safespotted
in various locations at the
Corsair Cove Dungeon
by travelling to
Corsair Cove
by
Cabin Boy Colin
, found on the piers to the west of
Rimmington
. Ogress Warriors and Ogress Shamans have a combat level of 82 with 82
hitpoints
. They are recommended to be fought with Ranged of 60 to maintain profit but 50 Ranged is doable but slow to kill. For Ranged levels 70–99, they provide the optimal combination of drops and experience.
Accurate
attack style may be more effective than
Rapid
due to the ogresses' high ranged defence. While they are tougher enemies to kill, Ogress Shamans have less ranged defence than Ogress Warriors, which makes Ogress Shamans a better option to train on for mid-level and high-level Ranged users. Due to the low range of Ogress Shamans' magical attacks, Ogress Shamans can be safespotted with a shortbow with the attack style set to Accurate or Rapid while still being out of the Ogress Shaman's magical attack range. Even though Ranged XP gained per hour will be slightly lower than ankou and lesser demons due to the Defence of ogresses, ogresses drop valuable items at an uncommon rate such as
rune med helms
(
11,038
),
rune full helms
(
20,609
) and
rune battleaxes
(
24,422
) that can be
high level alchemised
by players with 55+ level
magic
.
Before training and profiting on ogresses, it is recommended to:
Bring hundreds or thousands of
adamant arrows
if the player can afford a massive amount of these for faster damage per second and experience. For better profit and relaxation while fighting, bring
mithril arrows
as they are often cheaper than
adamant
or
steel
. High-level ranged players should often gain a profit from the amount of arrows they will use against ogresses, even with the more expensive arrows. Ogresses also drop arrows that range from
iron
to mithril, which could also be used as substitute should the player run out of their primary arrows or save their strongest arrows.
55 or higher
Magic
: Bring
nature runes
and a
staff of fire
(optional as ogresses can drop
fire runes
and nature runes) to
high level alchemise
rune
drops and
mithril kiteshields
(
1,096
).
Optional: Bring a
chisel
to cut
gems
for passive
Crafting
experience, or if you plan on casting high level alchemy on the gems (
sapphires
are recommended to be dropped after being cut due to their low high level alchemy value).
Optional: Runes for
Falador Teleport
and travel down to Rimmington.
Bring few pieces of food if needed as ogresses can deal up to 8 hitpoints of damage. Ogresses stop becoming aggressive in a short area after staying in the area for 10 minutes. Alternatively, loaves of
bread
spawn in certain areas of the Corsair Cove Dungeon.
Lesser demons (combat level 82)
The
lesser demons
in
Karamja
and
Crandor
are an alternative to moss giants at level 65+ Ranged, but are slower experience because of their high Defence, and do not have good drops, only notably dropping
rune med helms
and
fire runes
. They always drop
vile ashes
that can be used for either
Prayer
training or to be sold on the Grand Exchange for extra money.
Lesser demons in Karamja volcano can be accessed and safespotted from any level, provided you can survive the short sprint past them to one of the safespots. It's recommended to fill your inventory with cheap
food
for the initial sprint to the safespot, and to heal damage for the first 10 minutes when running out to pick up drops. After 10 minutes, as long as you continue training at the same safespot, the lessers will become
tolerant
and drops can be safely picked up without taking damage. Since they have a large amount of hitpoints (~80) and high defence, and training is completely safe after the first 10 minutes, lesser demons are a common place for players to afk train Ranged.
Ankou (combat levels 75, 82 or 86)
Ankou
are another alternative to moss giants for players with 60+ Ranged, and although the level 75 ankou can have Defence lower than lesser demons, the level 82 and 86 ones that have safespots have much higher Defence and are slower experience. Ankou have very few good drops in free-to-play, which include
law runes
,
left skull halves
which can be chiseled into
bone fragments
, noted
mithril ore
, or noted
rune essence
for
ironmen
.
Ankou can be found either in the
Stronghold of Security
level 4 or
The Forgotten Cemetery
in level 30
Wilderness
. They are aggressive to players of all combat levels but can be safespotted at both locations, most easily over a skeleton on the floor in the south-western room of Stronghold of Security level 4.
