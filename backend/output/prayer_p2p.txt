Training
Prayer
can be quite costly, but it is a very important skill due to its utility in combat.
Many
quests
recommend having 43 Prayer, as this allows a player to use all available protection prayers. Other important milestones include Level 50 for completing all quests, Level 77 for unlocking all prayers and Level 85 for completing all
Achievement Diaries
. Having a higher Prayer level also allows the player to restore more prayer points per
prayer potion

/
sanfew serum
dose.

Starting off
Early levels can be skipped by completing
quests that give Prayer experience
.
Completing
The Restless Ghost
,
Priest in Peril
,
Recruitment Drive
, and
Holy Grail
will grant a total of 14,531 Prayer experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 30.
Spirits of the Elid
has more requirements, but gives another 8,000 Prayer experience.
Active training
Cremating urium remains
Main article:
Money making guide/Cremating urium remains
Cremating
urium remains
only rewards 35,000 Prayer experience per hour (or up to to 57,000 Prayer experience per hour with
Hard Morytania Diary
and max efficiency), but it is the fastest way to obtain the
zealot's robes
. The robes provide a 1.25% chance per piece to prevent various remains from being consumed whilst training Prayer – totalling 5% with the full set equipped. Given that most Prayer training methods are relatively expensive, the zealot's robes can be beneficial to obtain early.
At an average cost of 8 gp/xp, 1 million Prayer experience would normally cost
8,000,000
and the zealot's robes would reduce that amount by
400,000
.
On average, 512
gold keys
are needed to obtain the full zealot's set, which calls for cremating approximately 648 urium remains at level 95 Firemaking (or 3,273
fiyr remains
at level 80 Firemaking). Cremating 648 urium remains would cost
7,110,504 coins
upfront and take approximately
2-3 hours
. The rewards from cremating the remains typically make this a profitable activity in addition to earning the full set of zealot's robes.
Offering bones at a gilded altar
The fastest way to train Prayer is to offer
bones
at a
gilded altar
in a
player-owned house
. When both
incense burners
are lit, the altar gives 350% experience per bone when a bone is offered at it. For example, burying a dragon bone gives 72 Prayer experience, but using it on the gilded altar with two incense burners lit would give 252 experience. While this method is the fastest way to train Prayer, it is also very expensive. Players who seek to save money are advised to offer bones at the Chaos altar in the Wilderness instead, as this is only slightly slower but offers twice as much experience per bone when compared to the gilded altar.
Building a gilded altar requires level 75
Construction
, which can be boosted. The tier of incense burner does not matter, as all three types (
oak
,
mahogany
, and
marble
) yield the same experience bonus and remain lit for the same amount of time. Lighting an incense burner requires level 30
Firemaking
and a
marrentill
herb, and both incense burners must be lit for the highest experience bonus. It is also recommended to have level 45
Magic
for
Camelot Teleport
and
Teleport to House
.
2000
Use the bank chest near
Camelot Castle
in a
PvP world
when offering bones. It is the closest one to a teleport and within a safe area from player killers. Equip a
dust battlestaff
, and keep a
tinderbox
and
law runes
in the inventory. Withdraw 24 bones and two
marrentills
, teleport to the house, light the incense burners, and offer the bones at the gilded altar. Use each bone manually at the altar to speed up the process. Teleport back to Camelot and repeat.
Players who do not have the Construction level to build a gilded altar can use the altar of a house party host for free. Ironmen cannot use this method as they are unable to access friend POHs. The official
worlds
for hosted gilded altars are
330
(US East),
465
(Germany) and
512
(UK) at the
Rimmington
house portal
. Take noted bones and unnote them at
Phials
located in the
Rimmington General Store
store for 5 coins each.
Experience rates vary depending on the type of bone used and performance. With good banking and accurate clicks, players can offer 2,550 bones per hour when manually using the bones on the altar. This equates to around 1,340,000 experience per hour when using
superior dragon bones
, or 643,000 experience per hour when using
dragon bones
. The rates can be increased up to 3,500 bones per hour if using alternative accounts to light the incense burners and bringing bones from the bank, or even higher if hiring runners. If the player is not manually using the bones on the altar, only up to 1,070 bones per hour can be offered.
More information about experience rates and costs can be seen
below
. Currently, offering superior dragon bones costs
36.94
coins per experience, and dragon bones
10.00
coins per experience.
Offering blessed bone shards to the libation bowl
Sacrificing blessed bone shards at the libation bowl.
Requiring level 30 Prayer, offering
blessed bone shards
to the
libation bowl
within
the Teomat
is slightly slower, but offers more experience per bone compared to the gilded altar.
Fill the bowl with either
jugs of blessed wine
or
jugs of blessed sunfire wine
, then sacrifice
blessed bone shards
as an offering for either 5 or 6 Prayer experience per shard. One jug of blessed wine fills the libation bowl enough for 400 blessed bone shards to be sacrificed in total. Each offering drains two Prayer points; players can recharge their prayer at the
Shrine of Ralos
in the southern building.
Up to 100 blessed bone shards can be sacrificed per action, for a total of either 500 or 600 Prayer experience. Sacrificing happens automatically (4
ticks
per action) so long as the player has remaining jugs of blessed wine, blessed bone shards, and Prayer points. Sacrificing can also be sped up (1 tick per action) by clicking manually.
With a full inventory of 27 jugs of blessed sunfire wine, a player could sacrifice up to 10,800 bone shards per inventory, awarding 64,800 Prayer experience in only 65 seconds of sacrificing. Of course, this would also drain 216 Prayer points, so a few trips would need to be made to restore Prayer points at the Shrine of Ralos nearby.
The
zealot's robes
do
have a chance to save sacrificed blessed bone shards, and can trigger separately for each individual shard (rather than per sacrifice of 100). They will not save "charges" of the filled libation bowl, however.
Obtaining shards
The fastest way to obtain blessed bone shards is to bless
bones
at the
exposed altar
nearby, then break them down with a
chisel
; the amount of shards received is dependent on the type of bone blessed.
Virilis
at the bottom of the altar will un-note bones for 10 gp per item.
Bones are broken down automatically (4 ticks per action). This can be sped up (0 ticks per action) by using the chisel on blessed bones manually. With active effort, around 4,000 bones can be un-noted, blessed, and broken down per hour; otherwise 1,000 bones can be broken down automatically.
Aside from monster remains, there are alternative ways of obtaining blessed bone shards. For example, mining
Calcified rocks
in the
Cam Torum mine
is a relatively AFK method of receiving bone shards; around 2,200 shards can be banked per hour (including trips to break down
calcified deposits
), netting around 11,000 to 13,200 banked Prayer XP per hour. With optimal gear, levels and focus, upwards of 20,000 banked Prayer XP per hour can be obtained this way.
Obtaining blessed wine
The
Culinaromancer's Chest
sells both jugs and grapes and has a nearby sink for filling the jug, making it an ideal location for creating
jugs of wine
. They may also be purchased, with the closest shop to a bank being
Sunlight's Sanctum
in
Aldarin
which offers an unlimited supply.
Jugs of wine
must be blessed at the
exposed altar
nearby into
jugs of blessed wine
. Alternatively, two
sunfire splinters
can be used on a jug of wine first to convert it into a
jug of sunfire wine
, which becomes a
jug of blessed sunfire wine
when brought to the exposed altar and grants 20% extra Prayer experience per shard.
With active effort, adding sunfire splinters to around 6,000 wines per hour can be expected. Automatic creation of sunfire wine takes 2.4 seconds each, so 1,500 wines per hour would be the theoretical limit.
As blessed wine
cannot
be banked, it is recommended that players only bring and bless wines at the exposed altar in proportion to the amount of shards they have.
General strategy
Demonstration of auto chiselling the bones at double speed.
Break down the desired amount of bones into
blessed bone shards
.
Bring a chisel and noted bones to
Virilis
at the Teomat, who charges 10 coins for each bone un-noted.
Bless the bones at the
exposed altar
.
Break the bones down into blessed bone shards. You can substantially speed this by repeatedly using the chisel on the bones. If you do not want to spam click, you can still automatically process them at double speed by clicking "Break-down" on one bone, and then "Use"ing a chisel on another within the same
tick
.
Run back to Virilis and repeat.
Offer the blessed bone shards to the
libation bowl
.
Bring your blessed bone shards and a full inventory of (sunfire) wine to the Teomat
. Optional
: Make jugs of sunfire wine while running by using
sunfire splinters
on a pestle and mortar with the wines present in your inventory. This process can also be sped up by using the sunfire splinters on the pestle and mortar repeatedly.
Bless the wines at the
exposed altar
.
Sacrifice at the
libation bowl
.
You can repeatedly click the libation bowl to perform sacrifices faster.
Restore prayer as needed at the
Shrine of Ralos
.
Optional
: Use
prayer potions
or a
Falador shield
for higher efficiency.
Bank and repeat. The quickest way is to teleport to a bank using an equipped item such as a
ring of dueling
, then returing to Ralos's Rise using a
pendant of ates
.
Restoring stamina
For extended Prayer training sessions, players may need to restore stamina occasionally. An easy way to bank without any additional items is to use the
quetzal transport
at the Teomat to Quetzacalli Gorge. Another method that does not take up an inventory slot involves equipping a
ring of dueling
to teleport to
Fortis Colosseum
where there is both a bank and a
quetzal
nearby for fast transport back to the Teomat; this requires
Hero status
in the Colosseum. Alternative methods of restoring run energy without taking up an inventory space include a
Construction cape
(provided players have a
Revitalisation pool
in their
home
), a
Desert amulet 4
to teleport to the
Elidinis Statuette
in
Nardah
, or drinking a
stamina potion
at the bank.
The Teomat
has a list of other methods of efficient transportation after banking.
Experience rates
As the whole process of gaining experience is quite complex, the experience rates below are only estimates.
For a comparison of experience rates and cost across different Prayer training methods, see
further below
.
By using existing shards
As prayer points are drained while sacrificing, recharging prayer periodically is required. The player's prayer level determines how many recharge trips are required to use up one inventory of wine. Recharging at the nearby altar and returning to the bowl takes ~25 seconds. Assuming that replenishing supplies (banking for wine, blessing it, and recharging prayer) takes around 65 seconds, it is not efficient to do another prayer recharge run if less than 40% of one prayer bar worth of wine is left - it is more efficient to bank.

Prayer restoration is a major component of the entire cycle time; by using
prayer potions
there is no need to leave the bowl and even higher rates can be attained. Supposing
Sunfire splinters
are losslessly added to
Jugs of wine
during the run from the
Quetzal
to the
Exposed altar
, with an inventory consisting of a stack of Sunfire splinters, a stack of
Blessed bone shards
, a
Pestle and mortar
, 184
Prayer points
worth of potions (Above level 64
Prayer
, 2
Prayer potions
will suffice, from level 56 Prayer until 64, 2
Super restores
will also suffice) and the remaining 23 inventory slots filled with Jugs of wine, an optimal run takes approximately 200 ticks (2 minutes); At this rate up to 1,656,000 XP/h could be achieved. Pre-preparing the
Jugs of blessed sunfire wine
or
taking advantage of other accounts using
Moonlight moth mixes
nearby the Libation pool to save two inventory spaces allows for 25 Jugs of wine per run, equating to 208 ticks (2 minutes and 4.8 seconds) per round trip and approximately 1,730,000 XP/h. Through the use of alt accounts to use Moonlight moth mixes
and
supply additional Jugs of wine, running back and forth between the Libation pool and the Exposed altar, a full round of 25
Jugs of blessed sunfire wine
would take an optimal 174 ticks (1 minute and 44.4 seconds) and would equate to approximately 2,069,000 XP/h.
By preparing sunfire wines
Assuming active effort is used for 5500 wines per hour, creation of sunfire wines adds around 16 seconds to the total trip time. That means trip length is 5-10% longer, but considering it adds 20% XP per shard, it is worthwhile in terms of efficiency.
By making shards
If the player produces their own shards from bones, the experience rates drop depending on the bones used. Assuming 4000 bones are processed per hour and 25 wines per inventory (10,000 shards) are used, some example time penalties can be found in the table below. The table shows that with dragon bones, the shard preparation time is quite similar to the time taken to sacrifice shards with a full inventory of wines at levels 62-99 when including sunfire wine preparation - meaning that for the aforementioned setup, all-in-all XP rate is about
half
of what is shown in the table above.
For example, 4000 dragon bones provide 232,000 shards, taking 155 seconds per 10,000 shards. Since 10,000 shards take 147 seconds to sacrifice at level 88+ Prayer, making your own shards roughly doubles the amount of time spent sacrificing (155 seconds added to the original 147 seconds).

Offering bones at the Chaos Temple
Offering
bones
at the
altar
within the
Chaos Temple
in the
Wilderness
is a slightly slower but a much cheaper alternative to the gilded altar. The temple is located in level 38 Wilderness, in a
multi-combat area
, so great caution must be exercised while employing this training method. The temple has an altar which grants 350% experience per bone offered at it (the same experience as a gilded altar with two burners lit), but also gives a 50% chance for the bone not to be consumed. This effectively doubles the amount of experience received per bone.  However, using the altar comes at the risk of having to face
player killers
who frequently like to hop between worlds at the location.
Players can take noted bones and un-note them at the
Elder Chaos druid
just outside of the temple for 50 coins per note (except on
Deadman Mode
worlds, where his service is not offered to Deadmen
[
1
]
). While convenient, this also increases the amount that the player is risking to player killers. Players who wish to minimise risk can take only an inventory of unnoted bones at a time and suicide to bank for more bones.
The fastest way to get to the altar is to use
Ghorrock Teleport
(or the respective house portal or the
teleport tablet
) and run south.
Alternatively, players who have an
Ancient Obelisk
in their player-owned house and have completed
hard Wilderness Diary
can use it to teleport to level 44 Wilderness and then run south.
Another option is to use
Cemetery Teleport
on the
Arceuus spellbook
or the respective house portal and run north. This is a slightly slower method, but it has lower requirements.
Using the
burning amulet
to the
Lava Maze
entrance and running south-west is not recommended, except for players using the suicide strategy below. The Lava Maze entrance is often crowded by player killers due to its proximity to
Revenant Caves
and
King Black Dragon Lair
.
Experience rates vary depending on the bone used and the number of player killers. When bringing noted bones and manually using the bones on the altar, players can gain up to 1,800,000 experience per hour with
superior dragon bones
or 860,000 experience per hour with
dragon bones
. Higher rates can be achieved by using runners. If suiciding for every inventory of bones, players can offer up to around 2,000 bones per hour. This would equate to 1,050,000 experience per hour with superior dragon bones and 500,000 experience per hour with dragon bones.
Strategies
As the altar can also be used to recharge Prayer points, players can keep Protect from Magic and Augury prayers up while offering bones and pray at the altar when needed.
Planning to die
Players who wish to minimise the risk can travel to the altar from the bank for every inventory of bones, and suicide to get to the bank faster. While this is less risky than bringing noted bones to the altar, it is also slower.
For this method, it is strongly recommended to have the
respawn point
in
Ferox Enclave
or
Edgeville
. They are the closest respawn points to a bank, but also cost 5,000,000 coins to unlock. Alternatively, players can use PvP worlds, which have a bank chest right next to a respawn point.
This method goes as follows:
Take bones, a teleport to the Wilderness, and optionally a
locator orb
,
enchanted symbol
or a
dwarven rock cake
from the bank.
Teleport to the Wilderness, and run to the Chaos Temple. Offer the bones at the altar.
Lower Hitpoints with the locator orb or the dwarven rock cake, and suicide to the wine of zamorak spawn. Alternatively, let the
Chaos Fanatic
kill you.
Run from the respawn point to the nearest bank for more bones. Repeat the process.
Players can optionally wear a piece of defensive equipment, such as the
Dinh's bulwark
. This way, players have a better chance of surviving player killers long enough so they can use up all their bones before dying.
Alternatively, players can wear
Zealot's robes
when using the suicide strategy. The bone-saving effect of the altar stacks with the Zealot's robes, and wearing them would give slightly more value out of the bones. The Zealot's robes are protected over the bones on death.
Logging out
If a player wishes to avoid encounters with player killers, an option is to keep the logout menu open with the cursor placed over the logout button. Consider using the
::renderself
chat interface
setting to hide your character model on your own client, allowing you to see anyone who logs in beneath you. With careful attention, the player can quickly log out before being attacked. One disadvantage to this method is that it offers lower XP/hr than manually using the bones on the altar.
Bringing noted bones
Bringing noted bones is riskier, but a lot faster than using the suicide method. However, it is only viable for either high-level or very low-level players.
The Elder Chaos Druid located outside the Chaos Altar unnotes bones for 50 coins each.
Very low-level players (combat level 3–20) are often too low-levelled to be targeted by player killers. Such players can usually bring higher amounts of noted bones with lower risk. However, some low-level
combat pure
player killers can sometimes be found at the altar, so some caution should still be given.
High-level players should wear good defensive gear while 3- or 4-iteming more expensive armour pieces, and bring some
Saradomin brews
along with
sanfew serums
or
super restores
to have a higher chance of escaping player killers. Players will also have very limited space for supplies, as it is best to have as much inventory space as possible for the bones.
Gear setups can vary depending on how much money the player has available. It is generally best prioritise Magic defence while having decent defensive bonuses against Melee and Ranged attacks. When choosing protected items, the
fortified Masori body
or the
Armadyl chestplate
, a tank shield such as elysian/spectral spirit shield or dinh's bulwark, and staff of the dead (if using an off-hand shield) are considered the best options. The rest of the equipment should consist of fairly cheap or easily replaceable items.
If the player is confident using
Protect Item
, the
serpentine helm
or the
fortified Masori chaps
(or the
Armadyl chainskirt
) can be brought as the extra item. It is still possible to get smited, so it may be a good idea to keep the smite risk reasonable. In a certain death situation prioritise having enough Prayer points to keep Protect Item active.

Generally it is best to wear a
phoenix necklace
to reduce the chance of getting combo-ed out along with a
ring of wealth
, which offers a teleport out of the Wilderness while not taking up inventory space. With certain setups it may be better to bring a
ring of suffering (i)
and an
amulet of glory
for extra defence, although the player will miss out on the phoenix necklace's healing effect.
Using the
staff of the dead
with a powerful off-hand shield (such as the elysian or spectral spirit shield) offers the highest escaping potential. Having a very high Magic defence helps at not getting frozen inside the multi-combat area, thereby significantly increasing the chances of surviving. Players should keep the risk at a reasonable level, as it is still fairly likely to die to a larger team of player killers. Choose 3 pieces of equipment (4 if confident using
Protect Item
) that will be protected on death and some low-value equipment that you do not mind risking.

Ring of wealth is used to teleport out of the Wilderness, and it saves an inventory space when wearing a phoenix necklace.
The elysian spirit shield is the best option for overall tanking due to its damage reduction effect. However, the spectral spirit shield is much more affordable and arguably almost as good due to its considerably higher Magic defence bonus. Wearing the spectral spirit shield makes it a lot less likely to get frozen inside the multi-combat area, but should this happen, the elysian spirit shield offers much better survivability.
The staff of the dead has fairly high Magic defence and also offers a useful special attack, which halves the all Melee damage of your opponent(s) (all opponents that hit you in the time of the special attack) for one minute. A staff of light or staff of balance can also used instead as they have the exact same bonuses and special attack. Should the player not be able to use the staff of the dead, any other staff with high Magic defence bonus should be used instead.

This setup uses the Dinh's bulwark for Melee and Ranged defence and other equipment for Magic defence.

Players should keep the risk at a reasonable level, as it is still fairly likely to die to a larger team of player killers.

Reanimating
ensouled heads
and killing the reanimated monsters near the
Dark Altar
is a relatively slow training method, but it requires less effort than manually offering bones at a gilded altar or the Chaos altar. This method is mainly recommended for players who wish to save money on Prayer training and do not wish to go to the
Wilderness
, as offering bones at the Chaos altar offers a lot faster experience and is usually comparable in terms of cost.
For this method, using fairy ring code
C
I
S
for faster access to the Dark Altar, and a fast access to fairy rings, such as the
fairy ring in the POH
,
quest point cape
, or using the
Salve Graveyard Teleport
. Having the
rune pouch
is strongly recommended to save inventory space. It is also recommended to buy the ensouled heads in advance, as most of them have a low trade volumes on the Grand Exchange.
Experience rates vary depending on the type of ensouled head used and combat stats. With high combat stats, players can reanimate up to 220 ensouled heads per hour. This equates to around 343,000 experience per hour when reanimating
ensouled dragon heads
. Higher rates can be achieved by using a cannon to kill the reanimated monsters faster, but this makes the method slightly more expensive. Players will also gain some passive combat and Magic experience from this method.
More information about experience rates and costs can be seen at the
calculator page
.
Experience rates assume 220 reanimated monsters are killed per hour. Slightly higher rates can be achieved by using the dwarf multicannon to kill reanimated monsters faster.
GP/XP includes the cost of the ensouled head and the runes required to cast the respective spell. It does not include the cost of supplies (such as
super combat potions
) or teleports.

Demonic Offering
Since the three highest level Slayer masters assign at least 120 abyssal demons as a minimum, one can expect at least of 30,600 Prayer experience per task if casting the
demonic offering
spell on abyssal ashes, making that particular task a great passive training method for players who melee the monsters. Also, one may collect abyssal ashes from the floor in worlds where there is another player barraging, for a low intensity and cheap method.

Assumes 600 casts per hour on three ashes, awarding

Offering bones at the Ectofuntus
Worshiping the
Ectofuntus
gives 400% the normal experience. Although this is the second-highest guaranteed per-bone prayer bonus in the game, this is much less than the 700% theoretical average experience at the Chaos Altar. This is due to the 50% chance of the Chaos Altar not consuming bones. The libation bowl will either match the 400% increase in xp per bone, or exceed it, depending on the bone sacrificed and whether or not sunfire wine is used.
The Ectofuntus is a less common method of training prayer due to it being much slower and not much cheaper than gilded altars, but it can be sped up considerably with the daily rewards provided by the
Morytania Diaries
.
Passive training
Passive training can be the cheapest Prayer training method, and take no additional time, especially when combined with
Slayer
training or in the
Nightmare Zone
or similar areas where players plan to stay for a long time without banking their drops.
Bonecrusher
With the
bonecrusher
or
bonecrusher necklace
, when charged with
ecto-tokens
, if the player kills a monster that drops bones, the bonecrusher will automatically crush them, granting the player
half
the Prayer experience they would have received from burying the bones themselves, or full amount of experience if the
elite Morytania Diary
is completed, and consuming one charge.
Ash sanctifier
With the
ash sanctifier
, when charged with
death runes
, if the player kills a monster that drops ashes, the sanctifier will automatically scatter them, granting the player
half
the Prayer experience they would have received from scattering the ashes themselves, or full amount of experience if the
elite Kourend & Kebos Diary
is completed, and consuming one charge.
Reanimating ensouled heads
Ensouled heads
can be reanimated to passively train Prayer during Slayer tasks from monsters that drops them, such as
Bloodvelds
or
Abyssal Demons
.
Reanimation spells
can be directly cast on ensouled heads dropped on the ground from monsters as long as the player do not bank them. In addition, reanimated monsters counts toward Slayer tasks, with the exception of
Reanimated dragons
.
Ectoplasmator
With the
ectoplasmator
, if the player kills a
spectral
creature such as an
aberrant spectre
, the player receives Prayer experience equal to 20% of the monster's max health, rounded down. The ectoplasmator requires 40 Prayer, and it is a reward from the
Soul Wars
minigame
for 250
Zeal Tokens
. In addition, the ectoplasmator stacks with the
bonecrusher
when killing a spectral monster that also drops
bones
, like
ankou
.
Bird's Eggs
Occasionally, while
woodcutting
or emptying
Bird houses
, a bird's nest containing red, green, or blue
bird's eggs
can be obtained. These can be offered to the
shrine
at the
woodcutting guild
for 100 prayer xp each, allowing some passive experience while training other skills.
Experience rates and cost
For a dynamic calculator with user inputs, see
Calculator:Prayer
.
Comparison between bone offering methods
The table below compares the three primary methods of Prayer training for each type of bone at a
gilded
altar with two burners lit, the
Chaos
altar, and
shards
at the libation bowl. It does not include burying bones or using the Ectofuntus; for those methods, see
Calculator:Prayer/Bones
.
This table assumes you manually 'use' bones on altars/chisels for faster experience. This results in 2,550 bones/hour offered at a gilded altar, 2,000 bones/hour offered at the Chaos altar (costing only 1,000 bones/hour), and 1,700 bones/hour blessed + chiseled + offered at the libation bowl.
Experience rates do not assume using alternative accounts for running bones and/or lighting burners. If using one, you can expect to achieve rates 20–25% higher at a gilded altar, 40–45% higher at the Chaos altar, and perhaps 30-35% higher at the libation bowl.
GP/XP for the Chaos altar assumes effectively getting twice the experience per bone. It also includes the 50 coins unnoting fee per bone (which effectively only applies to half the bones), but does not include the cost of teleports, supplies and potential loss to player killers.
XP/hour for the libation bowl assumes having level 62+ Prayer for 3 prayer recharges per inventory of wine. It is also based on the number of inventories of wine required by
dragon bones
; lower-tier bones will require fewer trips to the libation bowl due to producing fewer shards/hour, slightly increasing the XP/hour shown here; higher-tier bones will require more trips to the libation bowl, slightly reducing XP/hour shown here. See
Calculator:Prayer/Blessed_Bone_Shards
for a more precise breakdown with user inputs.
GP/hour for the libation bowl assumes using sunfire splinters and paying Virilis to un-note bones.

Efficiency
Main article:
Efficiency
Because most Prayer training methods are available to players regardless of Prayer level, a main differentiator between training methods and bone choice is
cost
(coins per experience) and
speed
(experience per hour).
Imagine a choice between two made-up bones:
Small Bones cost
1,000 coins
each and grant 100 XP when buried (
10 coins
per XP)
Large Bones cost
4,000 coins
each and grant 200 XP when buried (
20 coins
per XP)
If you can feasibly bury 2,500 bones per hour, that means:
Small Bones provide 250,000 XP per hour.
Large Bones provide 500,000 XP per hour.
At first glance, paying twice as much per XP in order to gain XP twice as fast may seem like a reasonable tradeoff. However, the final factor is
actual time saved
, also called
efficiency
. Imagine you'd like to train Prayer from level 60 to level 70, requiring a total of roughly 500,000 XP. To gain that much XP:
Small Bones would take 2 hours and cost
5,000,000 coins
.
Large Bones would take 1 hour and cost
10,000,000 coins
.
That means it costs
5,000,000 coins
more to save 1 hour of time if you choose Large Bones instead of Small Bones in this made-up scenario. This would only ever be worthwhile if you can feasibly earn
more
than
5,000,000 coins
per hour with your time, or simply prefer doing other activities enough to accept the cost associated with saving that time.
In other words, if you can earn
1,000,000 coins
per hour doing some activity as your primary money-making method, then in order to afford training to level 70 Prayer:
You would need to spend 5 hours making money if using Small Bones (5 + 2 =
7 hours total
to 70 Prayer).
You would need to spend 10 hours making money if using Large Bones (10 + 1 =
11 hours total
to 70 Prayer).
