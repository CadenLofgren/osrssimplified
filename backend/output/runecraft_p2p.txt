General information and tips
Most Runecraft training methods involve using essence.
Pure essence
is most commonly used, as it can be used for all rune types and is typically cheaper than
rune essence
.
The
Raiments of the Eye
set grants 60% more runes when the full outfit is worn, though no extra experience is given. The outfit can be obtained through the
Guardians of the Rift
minigame. Getting the outfit is recommended if the player plans to train with profitable methods.
Drinking
stamina potions
is generally the best option for restoring run energy. The
ring of endurance
is also useful, as it reduces the run energy drain and doubles the duration of the stamina potion effect when charged.
Recommended quests
The quests listed in the table below offer very useful rewards for a lot of training methods. Completing them is strongly recommended before doing a lot of Runecraft training.

NPC Contact
can be used to quickly repair essence pouches. Casting this spell requires level 67 Magic.
Ourania Teleport
provides a very fast access to the
Ourania Altar
. Casting this spell requires level 71 Magic.
Magic Imbue
negates the need for a talisman when crafting
combination runes
. Casting this spell requires level 82 Magic.
Essence pouches
The
large pouch
.
Essence pouches
can be filled with essence and then emptied to add the essence back into the player's inventory. This allows the player to carry more essence per run, which will increase experience rates in most cases. A
small pouch
is given to the player after completing
Enter the Abyss
. A medium pouch is awarded after completing
Temple of the Eye
.
To fill an essence pouch, simply click on it while having essence in the inventory. The pouches can be filled without closing the bank interface. A filled essence pouch can be emptied by holding the Shift key and then clicking on the pouch. To enable the Shift-click empty configuration, toggle on 'Shift click to drop items' through
settings
.
Essence pouches are dropped by
abyssal leeches
,
guardians
, and
walkers
. They reside in the
Abyss
and in the
Abyssal Area
. The Abyss can be accessed through the
Mage of Zamorak
in level 5
Wilderness
north of Edgeville, and the Abyssal Area through the
fairy ring
A
L
R
. The pouches are dropped in increasing size; a player who already has the
small pouch
will get a
medium pouch
next, and so on. The pouches can be obtained prior to having the required Runecraft levels to use them. However, players cannot store any essence inside of them without the Runecraft level requirement.
The
colossal pouch
is made by using an
abyssal needle
to stitch together a small, medium, large, and giant pouch. This requires unboosted levels of 25 Runecraft and 56 Crafting.
The pouches above small degrade after enough use. When degraded, they will hold less essence than they normally would. To repair the pouches, talk to the
Dark mage
in the
Abyss
or via
NPC Contact
. The player can alternatively have
Apprentice Cordelia
repair the pouches for 1
abyssal pearl
after unlocking the service for 25 abyssal pearls. Repair the pouches right before they become degraded or as soon as they do. If the pouches are not repaired, they will eventually vanish after enough use, in which case the player will have to get new ones. The small pouch can be obtained from the Dark mage for free if lost.

Rune pouch
The
rune pouch
.
The
rune pouch
(not to be confused with
essence pouches
) can store 16,000 of three types of runes. It saves inventory space for methods where runes are used for casting spells, such as
NPC Contact
for repairing essence pouches. This will increase experience rates for those methods. To get a rune pouch, buy a
rune pouch note
from the Grand Exchange and use it on a banker in exchange for a rune pouch. A rune pouch note currently costs
6,105,781
.
Using daeyalt essence
Players who have completed
Sins of the Father
can obtain untradeable
daeyalt essence
through mining
daeyalt shards
. Mining the shards requires level 60 Mining. Daeyalt essence can be used and stored in
essence pouches
like
pure essence
, but provides a 50% bonus to Runecraft experience when used. The experience bonuses of daeyalt essence and
Ourania Altar
stack multiplicatively for a total of 255%. Like with pure essence, the daeyalt essence cannot be used in place of
dark essence fragments
to craft
blood
or
soul runes
at the Kourend altars.
Obtaining and using daeyalt essence is slower overall than buying pure essence from the
Grand Exchange
and using it. The efficiency can be calculated using this formula:
1
.
5
1
+
X
Y
Where
X
is Essence used per hour and
Y
is shards mined per hour.
Example
:
Someone uses up 2538 essence per hour at the
Ourania Altar
[

]
, and they mine about 4400 Shards at
daeyalt essence mine
per hour.

instead.
While the efficiency is below 100% most of the time, it is still a low-effort alternative to training
Runecraft
. Since you can spend one third of your training time AFK Mining, then only two thirds of the time actively running the essence to any altar while still getting (for example) 95% of the experience you would normally get. There is also little variance in daeyalt mining opposed to the fast clicks and quick banking required to Runecraft. If you can be 95% efficient mining Daeyalt, but only 75% efficient runecrafting, daeyalt will benefit your gameplay style, and may be more efficient overall. Maximum theoretical efficiency of mining shards with a
dragon pickaxe
is 4856 an hour.
Starting off
Levels 1–32/34: Questing
Early levels can be skipped by completing
quests that give Runecraft experience
. Completing
Enter the Abyss
miniquest
,
The Ascent of Arceuus
,
The Eyes of Glouphrie
,
Temple of the Eye
and
The Slug Menace
grants a total of 20,210 experience, which will get the player from level 1 to 33. This allows the player to craft
lava runes
right from the start or do the
Guardians of the Rift
minigame. All these quests have low requirements and can be done at a fairly low level.
Lunar Diplomacy
grants an additional 5,000 experience, which will get the player to level 36, but it has much higher requirements. However, being on the
lunar spellbook
is highly recommended for crafting lava runes and for
Ourania Altar
.
Levels 1–50: Making talisman tiaras
Making talisman
tiaras
is one of the fastest training methods up to level 50. It also has no quest or skill level requirements. This method is fairly click-intensive and can be very expensive depending on the talisman prices, so it is only recommended for players who wish to get through the early levels as fast as possible and do not mind spending some money. Crafting
lava runes
offers faster experience rates from level 50 onwards. Players who are looking for a lower-effort alternative to making talisman tiaras or crafting lava runes are advised to complete quests to skip the early levels and do the
Guardians of the Rift
minigame.
Talisman tiaras are made by using a talisman on the corresponding altar with a tiara in the inventory. The tiara can be also used on the altar, but the left-click option on tiaras is wear, so it is suggested to use the talisman instead. Wearing a tiara also makes the altar left-click and removes an animation on getting into the altar.
The
ring of the elements
is required for the fastest rates, as it provides fast teleports to all the elemental runic altars. Using an
amulet of glory
is recommended for fast banking, as equipping it allows the player to make 14 tiaras per inventory. A
ring of dueling
can alternatively be used for fast access to the altar and to the bank if making tiaras at the
Fire Altar
.
The experience rates assume 1,450 tiaras made per hour. With accurate clicks and good banking, it is possible to make up to around 1,550 tiaras per hour. The profit rates assume using a ring of the elements to get to the altar and the amulet of glory for banking.
Elemental tiaras
may not be viable due to low trading volumes.

Levels 23–99: Lava runes
Crafting
lava runes
is the fastest way to train Runecraft. They are made by visiting the Fire Altar with essence and at least an equal amount of earth runes. Having a
binding necklace
equipped ensures combination runes are crafted 100% of the time.
For the fastest rates, players will need level 82
Magic
and completion of
Lunar Diplomacy
to cast the spell
Magic Imbue
. It negates the need for a talisman in combination runecrafting, which will increase experience rates. Players who cannot use the spell will need to use earth talismans instead.
Solo lavas

An optimal setup consists of the following:
A
fire
or
elemental tiara
to enter the Fire Altar. An attuned
hat of the eye
may be used as well.
A
binding necklace
to consistently craft combination runes.
A
mist battlestaff
and a
tome of fire
(or
smoke battlestaff
and a
tome of water
) for unlimited
air
,
water
, and
fire runes
.
A
Crafting cape
or a
ring of dueling
for banking. Using Menu Entry Swaps allows for left-click teleports without removing your cape or ring.
Ring of the elements
(if using the
Crafting cape
) or a ring of dueling to get to the Fire Altar.
Weight-reducing clothing (optional).
A large stack of
earth runes
for crafting combination runes, used on the altar to craft the combination runes.
A
rune pouch
to bring
astral
and
cosmic runes
for
NPC Contact
and
Magic Imbue
.
Essence pouches
for bringing extra
pure essence
: with 75+ Runecraft, the
giant
and
large pouch
; without 75 Runecraft, all pouches available.
Pure essence for the rest of the inventory.
RuneLite
with Menu Entry Swapper for instant click teleports, fills, and emptying.
The
ring of the elements
spawns the player one tile closer to the altar than the ring of dueling on average, though as the player moves two tiles at a time this does not always save time. The ring of the elements carries more charges than the ring of dueling, making banking easier.
The player may want to only use the two largest essence pouches available. The time saved filling and emptying the pouches could result in faster laps and better experience rates, as well allowing the dueling ring and binding necklaces to discharge evenly. If using essence pouches without Magic Imbue, bring another earth talisman as the runes in the pouches would not be made into lava runes.
Experience rates are shown in the table below. The rates vary depending on performance and how many essence pouches are available. Before level 99, players can gain up to 93,000 experience per hour at maximum efficiency. Due to the click-intensive process this method involves, players may be more likely to see rates closer to 85,000–90,000 experience per hour. At level 99, the maximum possible experience rate caps at around 98,000 experience per hour.

Using lava runners
Crafting lava runes using essence runners is the fastest method to train Runecraft. This method is
very expensive
, so it is only recommended for wealthy players who wish to gain experience as fast as possible and do not mind spending a lot of money. It also requires good coordination and accurate clicks, as the player will need to rapidly accept trades and craft runes at the altar.
Essence running services have a considerable potential of having connections with
real-world trading
. Use caution and be selective when arranging essence running, as exchanging gold for an in-game service with real-world traders will risk the account getting
permanently banned
.
The fastest method is to have four runners run the essence while the runecrafter stands at the altar. Having two to three runners is only recommended for inexperienced runecrafters who are learning the method.
Alternatively, craft lava runes normally (as a solo player) and have 1 runner trade extra essence every lap. This method is also known as duo or 1+1 lavas. This method is slower than using 4 runners, but also cheaper.
A runner typically costs around 12-15 million coins per hour. The price can vary depending on the runner's experience.
Experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The costs assume the player is paying 12 million coins per hour per runner. The rates can also vary depending on how well the runecrafter and the runners perform. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to gain up to around 320,000 experience per hour.

The
Guardians of the Rift
minigame
is an alternative way of training Runecraft. In addition to Runecraft experience, the minigame also offers passive
Mining
and
Crafting
experience. The minigame is profitable and offers useful
rewards
, such as the
colossal pouch
for holding more essence and
Raiments of the Eye
set for crafting extra runes.
To participate in the minigame, players must have completed
Temple of the Eye
. The experience gained from completing the quest is enough to get the player from level 10 to 27, which is required for the minigame. There are also a number of quests that are very useful to have completed, which are listed below.
Lunar Diplomacy
to be able to cast
NPC Contact
to quickly repair essence pouches
Lost City
to craft cosmic runes
Troll Stronghold
to craft law runes
Mourning's End Part II
to craft death runes
Sins of the Father
to craft blood runes
Use the best
pickaxe
and all
essence pouches
available. The
rune pouch
is strongly recommended to save inventory space. Players who do not have the
Raiments of the Eye
outfit yet are advised to wear any tier of the
Varrock armour
to have a 10% chance to mine double
guardian fragments
at once. Players may also make use of the
celestial ring
if they have it.
Players who have the
abyssal lantern
should light it with
redwood logs
if possible. This makes it so the player does not need to repair essence pouches via NPC Contact, which saves 1–3 inventory slots, depending on if the player is using a rune pouch. Players who cannot use redwood logs or are wearing the
Runecraft cape
are advised to use
yew logs
for the point boost it provides. Also note that if the player is using
combination rune
strategies, redwood logs do not save any inventory space if
steam runes
are used to cast
magic imbue
, so yew logs are recommended.
Through Guardians of the Rift players can obtain the
Raiments of the Eye
set. It provides 10% more runes per piece worn and an additional 20% set bonus, for a total of 60% when wearing a full set. The
abyssal needle
is used to combine essence pouches into the
colossal pouch
. It can hold up to 40 essence, making it the best essence pouch to use. Valuable runes obtained through the minigame can be kept for later use or sold on the
Grand Exchange
for profit.
The experience rates in the table below assume using the best pouch(es) available. From level 85 onwards, the rates assume doing the minigame in small, coordinated teams for faster experience.

Levels 1–99: Ourania Altar
Crafting runes at the
Ourania Altar
(also known as the
ZMI
Altar) is a profitable lower-effort alternative to lava runes. The altar can be accessed at any Runecraft level. Unlike the other runic altars, the Ourania Altar converts essence into a random assortment of runes, which improves in cash and experience value as the player levels Runecraft.
For this method, players will need to have unlocked the
Ourania Teleport
on the
Lunar spellbook
for a fast access to the altar. This requires completion of
Lunar Diplomacy
and speaking to
Baba Yaga
while on the Lunar spellbook. Being on the Lunar spellbook is also needed for casting
NPC Contact
to quickly repair
essence pouches
. Having level 71 Magic is strongly recommended to be able to cast both of these spells.
Having the
rune pouch
is strongly recommended to have more inventory space for the essence. The
medium Ardougne Diary
reward increases the amount of runes that are crafted, however no experience is given for the extra runes.
The official worlds for the Ourania Altar are Worlds
327
and
480
. Use one of these worlds to have a lower chance of being targeted by the monsters, as the world will often be filled with other players training Runecraft. Alternatively, two alternate accounts can be used to lure the monsters so that they do not hit the player; this also allows training another skill such as Fletching whilst running to the altar for greater macro-efficiency.
Experience rates are shown in the table below, and assume players have all of the
essence pouches
available at each level. The rates and the experience per essence scale depending on the Runecraft level. At higher levels, the player can expect to make somewhere around 350,000–400,000 coins per hour depending on the rune prices.

Setup
To quickly access the bank, players need to pay 20 of any kind of rune (excluding combination runes) by setting a quick-payment deal with
Eniola
. Mind or elemental runes are usually the cheapest option. Clear the rune pouch and essence pouch space holders, and fill the entire bank with bank fillers (or use the bank's 'Deposit Lock Settings'). This way, the player can quickly deposit all the crafted runes without depositing any necessary items. Have essence, 1-dose
stamina potions
, and
cosmic runes
near the 'Deposit inventory' button for efficient banking.
The optimal setup consists of the following:
All essence pouches available
Dust battlestaff
(or a
staff of earth
and
air runes
) for casting
Ourania Teleport
and
NPC Contact
Rune pouch
holding payment,
astral
, and
law runes
. Bring
cosmic runes
as well if using the
divine rune pouch
.
Some defensive equipment (not needed if using alternative accounts to lure the monsters)
Raiments of the Eye
set for extra profit (optional but recommended)
Ring of endurance
with at least 500 charges (optional)
Players who find that they are taking a lot of damage can wear the
Hitpoints cape
along with a
regen bracelet
. This will most likely outheal any damage taken. Lower-level players are advised to bring more defensive equipment (such as wearing a
black d'hide body
and a
helm of neitiznot
) and use cheap food to heal themselves if needed. A
ring of suffering (i)
can be considered as an alternative to the ring of endurance if greater defensive bonuses are desired, or the
Steel ring
/
Granite ring (i)
if the suffering is too expensive.
Players who do not have level 71
Magic
to cast Ourania Teleport can use the
respective teleport tablets
instead, though this will require an extra inventory slot.
At level 75 Runecraft and higher, players may opt to replace law runes in the rune pouch with cosmic runes. This removes the need to withdraw cosmic runes for casting NPC Contact, and at higher levels it is very unlikely that the player will not craft any law runes at the altar. Players with the
divine rune pouch
can bring cosmic runes without this consideration.
The inventory and gear setup provided assumes using
Lunar spellbook
with 96 Magic to cast
Spellbook Swap
to
Arceuus spellbook
and cast
Vile Vigour
for run energy as needed (otherwise utilize stamina potions). Mind runes should be set up to be used as default when banking with
Eniola
.
Runecrafting and tips
Starting at the bank, run to the altar using the shorter route by running south and then east. Craft runes at the altar until you have run out of essence. Cast
Ourania Teleport
, run south-west to the ladder and climb down, and bank at Eniola. Drink a stamina potion dose to restore run energy whenever needed.
Turn off Auto Retaliate and set NPC 'Attack' options to 'Hidden' to avoid attacking and retaliating against the monsters. Turning the camera south allows for easy vision while running to the ladder and throughout the cave.
Instead of using stamina potions, players can restore run energy by casting
Spellbook Swap
to use
Vile Vigour
from the
Arceuus spellbook
. This method requires level 96 Magic and completion of
A Kingdom Divided
. Restore prayer points at the altar next to the Ourania Cave entrance.  Casting Spellbook Swap or Vile Vigour does not interrupt running, so it is best to cast the spells while running to the ladder leading to the cave.
Having the
divine rune pouch
allows the player to store soul, cosmic, astral and payment runes in one inventory spot. The player can use the law rune acquired from runecrafting at the altar to cast Ourania Teleport. Alternatively, players can store aether, law, astral and payment runes. This will remove the small chance of not creating a law rune at the altar.
If there are multiple players training Runecraft in the same world, the player can get to the altar with less effort by trading or using an item on other players running to the altar, provided that they do not stop at all. Following other players (instead of trading or using an item on them) is not recommended, as players can get stuck behind walls if there is enough distance between them. Using the increased draw distance of approved, non-standard clients such as
RuneLite
, it is possible to one-click from the cave entrance to the altar. This removes the need to follow others or click multiple times along the path.
Levels 77–99: Crafting blood/soul runes in Arceuus
Location of the
Dense essence mine
Crafting
blood
or
soul runes
in
Arceuus
is a profitable low-effort alternative to the faster training methods. This method also provides passive Mining and Crafting experience. Blood runes can be crafted at level 77 and soul runes at level 90.
Crafting runes in Arceuus requires level 38
Mining
, level 38
Crafting
, a
chisel
, and a pickaxe. The pickaxe tier does not matter, so use the black pickaxe or the lightest one available. A chisel spawns at the runestone mine. Having a high Agility level (78+) is recommended for faster run energy restoration, and a
ring of endurance
with at least 500 charges for reduced run energy consumption. Level 73 Agility is required for the western rock scramble shortcut. The medium
Kourend & Kebos Diary
reward grants the player a 5% chance to mine two
dense essence
blocks at once (no Mining or Crafting experience is given for the extra block), which will increase experience rates slightly.
Starting at the Arceuus essence mine, this method goes as follows:
Mine a full inventory of dense essence blocks.
Use them on the Dark Altar to create dark essence blocks.
Chisel the dark essence blocks into fragments while running back to the mine.
Mine a second inventory of essence blocks, and use them on the Dark Altar.
Chisel 1 dark essence block into fragments.
Head to the runic altar and craft runes.
Chisel the second inventory of dark essence blocks into fragments.
Craft runes once more and return to the essence mine.
The experience and profit rates in the table below assume completion of the medium Kourend & Kebos Diary and running to the altar. Expect lower rates if idling.

More information and tips
To get to the
Blood Altar
with fewer clicks, run a few steps west of the Dark Altar and click on the other side of the fence as shown above.
While using the Abyss can be slightly faster than running to the altar, doing so is generally not recommended because of the extra effort and risk involved. Players using the Abyss are advised to bank the runes every so often to reduce the risk to a potential player killer. To craft blood or soul runes via the Abyss, players must craft runes at the respective altar before using a dark essence block on the rift to unlock it.
Players who have completed the
elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary
and have a
revitalisation pool
and
fairy ring
in their
player-owned house
can alternatively use Teleport to house to make the procedure slightly faster and remove the need for the graceful outfit. A construction cape or rune pouch with law, dust, and an empty spot for the crafted runes will allow for no lost inventory slots. If on Arceuus spellbook, you can use Home teleport every half hour, which teleports you next to the altar.
For blood runecrafting, after making a second inventory of dark essence blocks teleport to your house, restore run energy with the pool, use the fairy ring
C
I
S
and run to the altar.
For soul runecrafting, after crafting runes at the altar teleport to your house, restore run energy with the pool, use the fairy ring
C
I
S
and return to the essence mine.
The chance for a runestone not to deplete scales with the Mining level. The Mining level thresholds and the expected depletion times are shown in the table below. The dragon pickaxe special attack can be used to boost the Mining level to the next threshold. Otherwise the pickaxe type does not matter, as blocks are mined every 9 ticks.

Other methods
Levels 1–99: Arceuus Library
Helping customers in the
Arceuus Library
is a viable Runecraft training method that has no requirements. To do this, talk to
Villia
or
Professor Gracklebone
to have them request a book. Ask
Biblia
on the top floor for a hint on where the requested book is, fetch the book, and give it to the customer. The customer will give a
book of arcane knowledge
in return. Read it and use option 2 for Runecraft experience, and continue by helping the other customer.
Sam
is further away from the book locations, so only fetch books for Villia or Professor Gracklebone.
Each book of arcane knowledge gives Runecraft experience equal to 5x the player's Runecraft level. Because of this linear scaling, it is strongly recommended to complete quests that give Runecraft experience to get past the initial slow experience. With good performance, players can turn in around 150–160 books per hour when using third party client features to find the books faster, however without them players can only turn in 90–100 books per hour.
Experience rates are shown in the table below. Use the
Arceuus Library Books Calculator
to determine how many books are needed to reach a target level or experience.

can be a profitable alternative to
lava runes
. Because of somewhat low trading volumes, the runes may take long to sell at a good profit.
Mud runes

ring of the elements
to get there.

Levels 50-99: Imbuing desiccated pages
Fighting the
Royal Titans
and forfeiting loot to receive
Desiccated pages
can provide competitive runecraft experience rates. The pages are untradeable and stackable, and can be converted into
burnt
,
soaked
, or
soiled pages
for 50 runecraft experience per page.
With high combat stats and suitable gear, in duos, this can work out at approximately 20,000 runecraft experience per hour for each player with additional combat experience and opportunities to receive the tertiary drops from the
Royal Titans
.
Levels 59–82/91: Double cosmic runes
For more information about runecrafting through the Abyss, see
Abyss/Strategies
.
Crafting
cosmic runes
requires completion of the
Lost City
quest. Even though cosmic runes become available at level 27, it is not recommended to craft them before level 59 due to much lower profit. Crafting double cosmic runes offers very slow experience, but it can yield good profit at lower levels depending on the rune prices.
The fastest way to craft cosmic runes is through the
Abyss
. Alternatively, players can use a
fairy ring
to teleport to
Zanaris
and run to the altar, which can be slightly faster for those with low
Mining
and/or Agility levels. Players will need to have level 66 Agility for the shortcut, as well as quick access to a fairy ring, such as the
quest point cape
,
Construction cape
or
necklace of passage
.
With 70+ Agility and a quest point cape or another form of quick fairy ring teleport, it is possible to get 60 inventories done per hour with high concentration using
essence pouches
. For this method, players should be on the
Lunar Spellbook
and have a
rune pouch
containing air, astral, and cosmic runes ready in their bank for casting
NPC Contact
when replacing their
ring of dueling
.
Stamina potions
, or a
revitalisation pool
in the player's
POH
, will also be required.

Crafting double
astral runes
can yield good profit depending on the rune prices. This method requires completion of
Lunar Diplomacy
. Even though astral runes become available at level 40 Runecraft, it is not recommended to craft them before level 82 due to much lower profit.
To craft astral runes, cast
Tele Group Moonclan
on the
Lunar spellbook
, run south-east to the altar, craft runes, and bank for more essence. Repair the essence pouches via
NPC Contact
and restore run energy as needed. Bank the astral runes from the
rune pouch
when it becomes full.
The optimal setup consists of the following:
All essence pouches available, or the colossal pouch.
Dust battlestaff
and the rune pouch with astral, law, and cosmic runes.
Crafting cape
or a
ring of dueling
for fast banking.
Raiments of the eye
set for extra profit (recommended).
Some defensive equipment to reduce damage taken from the
suqah
.
Ring of endurance
with at least 500 charges if using the Crafting cape (optional).
Experience and profit rates are shown in the table below. The rates assume using rings of dueling to bank at
Castle Wars
and using the best essence pouch(es) available. The profit rates include the cost of teleports, NPC Contact runes (before level 99),
stamina potions
, and
pure essence
. At level 99, it is possible to gain up to 59,000 experience per hour.
Some players like to use the Nardah teleport on the
Desert amulet 4
from the Elite
Desert Diary
to refill their energy and health by praying at the
Elidinis Statuette
. This eliminates the need for stamina potions, food and/or defensive equipment.

Levels 91–95/99: Double nature runes
For more information about runecrafting through the Abyss, see
Abyss/Strategies
.
Even though nature runes become available at level 44, it is not recommended to craft them before level 91 due to much lower profit. Crafting double
nature runes
without using the
Achievement diary cape
offers slow experience, but it can yield good profit depending on the rune prices. With the Achievement diary cape, experience and profit rates increase significantly, offering some of the highest profit per hour in Runecraft, along with competitive experience rates.
There are four main ways to reach the nature altar: by using the
Abyss
; by using the
fairy ring
C
K
R
and running north-east; by using the
Karamja gloves 3
or
4
teleport to the gem mine; or by using the Achievement diary cape teleport to
Kaleb Paramaya
. Both the Karamja gloves and the Achievement diary cape methods require level 79 Agility, in order to use the shortcut on the north wall of
Shilo village
.
The Achievement diary cape method is over twice as fast as the other methods; however, the cape has very high requirements. The Abyss, fairy ring and Karamja gloves methods are similar in speed. Players with level 79 Agility or higher should use the Karamja gloves method. Players with low Mining and Agility are likely to get higher rates using the fairy ring, and players without fast access to a fairy ring and without access to the Agility shortcut should use the Abyss.
Players using the Achievement diary cape can use the cape's teleport to
Jarr
for banking, saving the need for an extra bank teleport item. For the fairy ring method, players will need to have a quick access to a fairy ring that does not take up inventory space, such as
quest point cape
,
Construction cape
or
necklace of passage
; and use a
ring of dueling
to bank at
Castle Wars
.
Training Runecraft from level 91 to level 99 using this method requires 792,400 pure essence and yields 1,584,800 nature runes, which can be sold for tremendous profit.

Levels 95–99: Double law runes
For more information about runecrafting through the Abyss, see
Abyss/Strategies
.
Crafting double
law runes
offers very slow experience, but it can yield good profit depending on the rune prices. Players are able to craft two law runes per pure essence at level 95, and they grant 9.5 experience per pure essence used. Even though law runes become available at level 54, it is not recommended to craft them before level 95 due to much lower profit.
The fastest way of crafting law runes is through the Abyss. However, players cannot bring any weapons or armour as the
Law Altar
is located on
Entrana
. This can be overcome by bringing a
bronze pickaxe
to every trip and dropping it before entering the portal. It is faster to have a pickaxe in the inventory and use the Mining obstacles, than use the Thieving obstacles which do not require any space.
Alternatively, players can use the
balloon transport system
from
Castle Wars
to
Entrana
, run to the altar and bank at Castle Wars. This is slightly slower than using the Abyss, but requires paying less attention. Each trip with a balloon uses a regular log, and it is recommended to store multiple logs into the crates beforehand to save a bit of time. When arriving to Entrana, click straight north and this will result in the pathfinder generating a path to run all around the island, which can then be cancelled after crossing the bridge to get to the Law Altar.
Training Runecraft from level 95 to level 99 using this method requires 448,724 pure essence and yields 897,448 law runes, which can be sold for tremendous profit.

Crafting
aether runes
offers relatively fast experience and can be profitable depending on the
Grand Exchange
prices. They are crafted by using
soul runes
on the
Cosmic Altar
with
aether catalyst
in the inventory. Crafting aether runes requires level 90 Runecraft.
This method requires the following:
Soul runes
and
aether catalyst
in the inventory.
Level 82 Magic to cast
Magic Imbue
and
NPC Contact
, runes for them (astral, fire, water, air, and cosmic), and the
rune pouch
to save inventory space.
With completion of elite Lumbridge & Draynor Diary wear a mist/smoke battlestaff and a tome of fire/water, respectively, to save runes.
The crafted aether runes can be used for a
cosmic rune
for the NPC Contact spell.
Binding necklaces
to ensure combination runes are crafted 100% of the time.
Colossal pouch
(or essence pouches up to giant) to carry more essence per run.
Fast access to
fairy rings
. The
fairy ring
in the
player-owned house
and using the
Constuction cape
teleport is the best option.
Alternatively, use the
quest point cape
teleport or the
eternal slayer ring
.
Completion of the elite
Lumbridge & Draynor Diary
allows using fairy rings without a
dramen staff
.
Level 66 Agility for access to the
shortcut
in
Zanaris
.
A fast
bank teleport
, such as the
Crafting cape
or a
ring of dueling
.
Raiments of the Eye
set for extra profit (strongly recommended for this method).
Starting at the bank, use the fairy ring to Zanaris. Run south to the altar, going through the eastern jutting wall shortcut. Cast Magic Imbue, use soul runes on the altar to craft aether runes.
Experience rates in the table below assume using the POH fairy ring with the Construction cape and rings of dueling to bank at
Castle Wars
. Expect lower rates if using worse teleports or having extra items in the inventory. The profit rates include the cost of teleports, NPC Contact runes (before level 99), and
pure essence
. At level 99, it is possible to gain up to 104,000 experience per hour.

Levels 95–99: Wrath runes
Crafting
wrath runes
is a profitable alternative to the faster methods. This method requires completion of
Dragon Slayer II
. Players will also need to run past aggressive dragons, so dragonfire protection is necessary.
Players can gain up to around 44,880 experience per hour using this method assuming they are able to complete 85 runs/hour, though this requires decent focus and a nearly optimal setup to achieve. At this rate, players would also make
1,604,460
profit per hour at the current rune prices (
2,570,502.00
when using the
Raiments of the Eye
). Using this method from level 95 to 99 would take around 95 hours and would offer roughly
150,150,000
profit. A more relaxed pace of 75 runs/hour would yield an hourly rate of 39,600 experience and
1,415,700
profit (
2,268,090.00
when using the
Raiments of the Eye
), and would take approximately 107 hours to reach level 99 from level 95. Higher rates are possible but difficult to achieve without a
Max Cape
or
Runecraft Cape
to eliminate the need for repairing essence pouches.

Setup and runecrafting
The optimal setup consists of the following:
Wrath tiara
or
Raiments of the Eye
A shield that offers
dragonfire
protection, such as the
dragonfire shield
Mythical cape
Bank teleport
, such as the
Crafting cape
or a
ring of dueling
All essence pouches
Weight-reducing clothing
Regen bracelet
Some defensive equipment
Charged
Ring of Endurance
For efficient banking, players should have essence, 1-dose stamina potions, runes for
NPC Contact
, and some cheap food near the 'Deposit inventory' button. Players are also recommended to lock their mythical cape and essence pouch using deposit lock in the bank settings. This way, players can quickly deposit all the crafted runes without depositing any necessary items.
This method goes as follows:
Fill pouches and inventory with essence.
Teleport to
Myths' Guild
with the mythical cape.
Run through cave and into altar.
Craft wrath runes.
Teleport to a bank, and repeat the process. Drink stamina potions, eat food as needed, and repair the essence pouches as needed. Alternatively, you may teleport to your house or Nardah via the
Desert Amulet 4
to restore both health and run energy to conserve supplies.
Post 99
After level 99, experience rates will remain constant. Assuming that the player is wearing full
Raiments of the Eye
, is using
colossal pouch
, wears their
runecraft cape
and has access to the most efficient teleports and method-specific gear and items such as an
abyssal lantern
and
binding necklaces
, the table below provides some expected rates of experience per hour:
