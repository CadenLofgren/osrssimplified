This
guide
outlines the best methods for training the
Mining
skill
in
free-to-play
. Even though mining
runite ore
with 85 Mining is one of the fastest free-to-play money making methods, profit from lower level ores is very low so it is more efficient to drop mined ores when training and use the saved time for other money making methods.

Pickaxes
Pickaxes
are required to train
Mining
, ranging from
bronze
to
rune
. Each tier up decreases the
tick
interval between rolls to mine an
ore
and thus it is recommended to always use the highest tier pickaxe available. If the
Attack
level requirement is met, save an inventory space by equipping the pickaxe.

Levels 1–99
Level 1–10: Doric's Quest
It is recommended to complete
Doric's Quest
early on for the reward of 1,300
Mining
experience
, enough to level Mining from 1 to 10. It can be completed immediately by already having the required materials, 6
clay
, 4
copper ore
, and 2
iron ore
.
While the clay and copper ore can be mined easily at level 1, the iron ore requires level 15 to mine. However, it can be obtained easily from the
Grand Exchange
or as an uncommon drop from
dwarves
which can be found near the
Dwarven Mines
to the east of Doric's house.
Levels 1/10–15: Copper ore/Tin ore
Mine
copper
and
tin rocks
to 15 Mining for 17.5 each. If banking the ores for
Smithing
, mine at the
South-east Varrock mine
and bank in the eastern
Varrock
bank
, otherwise the safest and easiest location are
East Lumbridge Swamp mine
or the northern
Dwarven Mines

Experience needed for 15 from 10: 1,111
Copper ore
or
tin ore
required for 15 from 10: 64 (1,120 experience)
Levels 15–99: Iron ore
The fastest experience from this point onward is from
iron rocks
for 35 experience each. Maximise experience by dropping ores and from mining at locations where one tile is surrounded by three iron rocks for zero travel time while waiting for respawns. At 41 Mining with a
rune pickaxe
all three ores can be mined and the player can face back towards the first just before it respawns, allowing for non-stop mining. The only location in free-to-play with one tile surrounded by three iron ores is
Al Kharid Mine
, which has aggressive level 14
scorpions
.
At 41 Mining, the maximum experience rate is around 50,000 experience per hour. At 61 Mining, the chance of successfully harvesting the iron ore becomes 100% - as iron rocks take 5.4 seconds (9 ticks) to respawn, this means that three iron ores can be mined every 12 ticks (3 tick mining time and 9 tick respawn time). The maximum experience rate is 52,500 experience per hour. Using
Tick manipulation
with food such as cakes the experience rate can increase to a maximum of 68,000 experience per hour
[

]
by using an alt or a runner to replenish the food as you run out.
4-tick mining
can also be performed by using leather and a needle with thread in the inventory. This allows continuously mining 3 iron rocks every 12 ticks in other locations, such as the
Citharede Abbey mine
, where 3 rocks are located so that each can be reached in 1-2 ticks from the previous in the cycle.

Money making methods
Levels 30–99: Superheat Item
Superheat Item
can be used at 43
Magic
and the appropriate
Smithing
level to smelt a bar without a
furnace
. This reduces the need to
bank
when Mining, especially for
coal
. Equip a
staff of fire
, and keep
Nature runes
and a
pickaxe
in the inventory for 26 open spaces. If purchasing the ore, bring 26 minus the amount of coal required to superheat the bar, otherwise, mine them as you mine coal. This will allow mining of a significant amount of coal between trips to the bank while producing bars:

With an
imbued Skull sceptre
, the
Barbarian Village mine
has the
closest
coal rocks
, and banking can be done with the
Falador teleport
. With a high
Mining
level, hopping worlds or using a different location may be required due to mining speed and coal respawn time. Otherwise, the time save is significant.
Alternative locations with an abundance of coal included: the
Mining Guild
, the
West Lumbridge Swamp mine
, the
South-west Wilderness mine
, and the
Dwarven mine
for additional mining locations. With this method, some mines located farther away than others from a bank become more viable due to bank travel taking up proportionally less time.
Levels 70–85: Adamantite ore
Mining
adamantite ore
can be a good free-to-play money-making method. The best place to mine adamantite is within the
Mining Guild
, requiring 70 Mining. It has two rocks and ores can be banked at the east Falador bank. Hopping worlds is faster than waiting for them to respawn. Mining adamantite rocks give 95 experience each. See
Money making guide/Mining adamantite ore (free-to-play)
for more information.

Levels 85–99: Runite ore
Runite mining is highly profitable, but
extremely
slow and dangerous because the only
runite rocks
are in the
Wilderness
at the
Lava Maze runite mine
. Like adamantite, it is faster and safer to hop worlds instead of waiting for ores to respawn. Mining runite rocks give 125 experience each. See
Money making guide/Mining runite ore (free-to-play)
for more information.

Other methods
Levels 1/10–14/15: Rune essence
With the completion or progression of
Rune Mysteries
, players can mine
rune essences
at the
rune essence mine
to create
runes
for
Runecraft
training later or drop them for faster Mining rates. As for training Mining, this is a slow training method with each rune essence giving 5 experience (a total of 140 Mining experience per inventory) but it's the only AFK-able training method until the player can access the
Ruins of Camdozaal
after completing
Below Ice Mountain
.

Levels 10–99: Crashed stars
Crashed Stars
are part of the
Shooting Stars
Distraction and Diversion
. Mining them yields low experience per hour, but is very AFK, as you can mine for seven minutes before having to click again when it degrades a tier. Expect approximately 8,000-13,000 experience per hour at level 70. In
free-to-play
it is much more difficult to find stars, so it is recommended to join a group that shares locations, such as the Shooting Stars chat channel on the game's chat interface. There are also several
RuneLite
plugins that can help F2P players and members alike in finding stars. Otherwise, for F2P players, world hopping at locations is required to find stars which can be difficult and take a lot of time.
Levels 14–99: Barronite shards and deposits
Completing the free-to-play
Below Ice Mountain
quest
rewards the player with access to the
Ruins of Camdozaal
where you can mine
barronite shards
from
barronite rocks
. Mining barronite shards gives 16 experience each and mining
barronite deposits
gives 32 experience each, making this a slower training method than mining
iron ore
but it is very AFK-able compared to
iron ore
, making barronites a good training alternative to iron ore and an improvement over mining rune essence. Barronite shards can be used to purchase rewards from
Ramarno
and while the barronite deposits can be used for Smithing, dropping them is recommended if solely training Mining.
Purchasing the permanent
Charm of Mining
buff and the one-hour
Charm of Boost
from
Ramarno's Shard Exchange
yields higher experience rates.
Observed experience rates at level 75 Mining with both buffs active is around 18,000–20,000 experience per hour.
