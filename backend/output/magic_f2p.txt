Free-to-play Magic training
Magic training
This article is about the free to play guide. For the pay-to-play guide, see
Pay-to-play Magic training
.
Magic
is a useful skill in
RuneScape
, and especially in free to play, because there is no access to
magic tablets
, so many
teleports
are only available by leveling Magic.

The
staff of air
for
wind spells
is recommended to save runes as damage scales with the highest level spell in that
combat spell
tier. Use other staves for enemies with a specific
elemental weakness
to gain more Magic XP from the maximum damage boost. But for best Magic experience for monsters without an elemental weakness or is weak to fire,
staff of fire
for
fire spells
would give the most base Magic XP at the cost of air runes.
^
2.0
2.1
The regular
skull sceptre
cannot autocast spells in free-to-play. However, the
imbued version
can autocast
Crumble Undead
but not other spells.
Before you begin training
Before you can begin training Magic, you'll need what every great mage requires:
runes
! Every spell requires at least one type of rune, and many spells require three and sometimes even four different types of runes to cast.
At level 1 Magic, you'll only be able to cast
Wind Strike
, which requires one
air rune
and one
mind rune
. With a
staff of air
equipped, you have access to unlimited air runes, so that you don't need air runes. There are staves for every basic type of rune; these staves are referred to as
elemental staves
, and will help assist in training Magic and give you unlimited runes for that element.
Quests
Some quests give Magic experience on completion:
Imp Catcher
rewards 875 Magic experience
Witch's Potion
rewards 325 Magic experience
Together, these quests are enough experience to raise from level 1
Magic
to level 10
Magic
before casting any spells. This means your
Wind Strike
's maximum hit will start at 6.
Obtaining runes
There are a few ways in which you can get your hands on runes. Each method has its perks, though some methods will make gathering them faster.
Buying from a shop or the Grand Exchange
Certain free-to-play runes can be bought from shops such as
Aubury's Rune Shop
(individually or as
item packs
), and all free-to-play runes can be purchased from other players on the
Grand Exchange
. The advantage in this method is that you can generally obtain a large stock of runes much faster than you could by crafting them, though buying runes generally results in spending more gold, and needing more gold to begin training.
The following table can be consulted for store and Grand Exchange prices of free-to-play runes:

Crafting runes
You may choose to craft your own runes through
Runecraft
at any of the various
runic altars
, which is possibly the fastest way aside from buying from another player or from one of the
magic shops
. The downside is that free-to-play players cannot craft
cosmic
,
nature
,
law
,
chaos
, or
death runes
.
Crafting runes requires
rune essence
or
pure essence
, and either a
talisman
or
tiara
that is compatible with the specific altar (for example, you may not use a
fire talisman
or
fire tiara
on the
Air Altar
to gain entry into the Air Altar and create air runes, instead you would need an
air talisman
or
air tiara
). For more details on methods of effectively crafting runes, see the
Free-to-play Runecraft training
article.
Killing monsters
Level 7
dark wizards
found at the
Varrock
stone circle
have some of the best drop rates for
runes
of any monster in free-to-play, only falling short of much higher level monsters such as
ogress warriors
and
shamans
. They drop all free-to-play
rune types
with the exception of
death runes
, and given their low
Hitpoints
and max hit combined with their vulnerability to all
attack styles
, one can obtain quite a large stockpile of
runes
fairly quickly. It is however recommended to have at least
combat level
41 to avoid
aggression
from the much more dangerous Level 20
dark wizards
nearby.
For those with a lower combat level, Level 9
wizards
found at the
Wizards' Tower
offer similar
rune
drop rates, but with lower quantities and lacking
cosmic runes
. They also have a higher max hit and slightly more
Hitpoints
.
Some higher level monsters such as
hobgoblins
,
hill giants
,
moss giants
, and
ice giants
also drop a variety of
runes
, but at much lower drop rates and/or quantities. Their higher levels also mean that drops won't be obtained anywhere near as quickly as with
dark wizards
or
wizards
.
How to train Magic efficiently
Level 1–17
It's highly recommended to use a
staff
if possible, because you can cast much more easily by going into combat options, clicking on the spell button, and choosing the spell you wish to
autocast
, instead of manually clicking the spell each time.
The following equipment is useful for training Magic:
Amulet of magic
Blue wizard robe
Zamorak monk bottom
Wizard hat
Casting
Wind Strike
on the
cows
around
Lumbridge
is a good way to get a few levels quickly, and also profit from the
cowhides
that they drop. You can either sell the hides, or tan them at
Ellis
, the tanner in
Al Kharid
, and then sell for even more profit, or even use the leather that you obtain from tanning for use in the
Crafting
skill. A few
shrimps
or
jugs of wine
is all you need for healing while you kill cows and collect cowhides. As you level, you will gain access to more spells like
Water Strike
at level 5,
Earth Strike
at level 9, and
Fire Strike
at level 13, which you can use instead of Wind Strike to maximise experience gains.
Alternatively, you can choose to kill something else with a similar combat level, such as
goblins
,
chickens
,
rats
,
spiders
, or
ducks
.
It's also possible to cast non-offensive spells that do not give
Hitpoints
experience, like
confuse
or
curse
, depending on what sort of account you wish to build.
Level 17+
At level 17, you can begin using
Wind Bolt
, increasing the amount of damage you can do, and may use stronger
bolt spells
at their respective levels.
Options for further training include:
Hill Giants
in
Edgeville Dungeon
which drop
big bones
and
limpwurt roots
, and can be attacked from
safespots
.
The
lesser demon
in
Wizards' Tower
which drops runes and other valuables. Note:
Telekinetic Grab
is required to collect the drops.
Al Kharid warriors
in
Al Kharid
(usually crowded).
Hobgoblins
in
Edgeville Dungeon
are also an option which drop
limpwurt roots
and has a few
safespots
.
There are three level 21
skeletons
in
Varrock Sewers
; the player can attack them from a safe location on one side of the water.
Level 33+
At level 33, you can begin using
Telekinetic Grab
, allowing you to profit whilst training Magic and opens lots of options for Magic combat and passive training.
Hobgoblins
can be safespotted from the cow field behind the
crafting guild
.
Telegrab the
limpwurt roots
and nature runes.
Do take note that most of the time your character will try to go around, though.
Wine of Zamorak
from the
Chaos Temple
in
Asgarnia
(recommended) or the
Chaos Temple (hut)
in the
Wilderness
.
Recommended Method:
If telegrabbing the wine from the
ground floor
[
UK
]
1
st
floor
[
US
]
, bring
wizard's mind bombs
to restore your stats as taking the wine will inflict damage and stat-draining effects on you. If your Magic level is drained below 33, you will not be able to cast Telekinetic Grab.
If telegrabbing the wine from the
ground floor
[
UK
]
1
st
floor
[
US
]
the monks will become aggressive to the caster. However, should you leave the temple, they will not be able to step outside the temple to pursue you.
You can use this to your advantage to train your Magic further by bringing either
Mind runes
or
Chaos runes
to cast
Wind Strike
/
Wind Bolt
; as the monks have a chance to drop
Zamorak monk bottoms
, this can increase your profit further.
Alternately, if you have a total level of 500 and are wearing
Zamorak monk robes
, you can climb the ladder to the
1
st
floor
[
UK
]
2
nd
floor
[
US
]
, where there is a second Wine of Zamorak on the table which does
not
inflict damage or stat drains if telegrabbed.
Nature runes
in the
Wilderness
, south-east of the
Demonic Ruins
. (Do not take anything that you cannot replace / are not willing to lose.)
Recommended Method:
Take 200 law runes, 200 earth runes, 200 water runes, 200 Chaos runes, 2 nature runes, and fill the rest of inventory with jugs of wine, wield air staff and set Wind Bolt as your auto-attack spell
Wear a
Blue wizard hat
, a
Blue wizard robe
, a Zamorak monk bottom, an
Amulet of magic
and either a
Wooden shield
,
Training shield
or
anti-dragon shield
.
Telegrab both piles of nature runes from the small peninsula, then switch worlds.
If you are attacked by a player, cast Bind, then Earth Bolt, (have wind bolt as your auto attack), then fight or run away and drink wines as needed.
The
Greater demons
in the Wilderness located near the Demonic Ruins can be safe-spotted from near the nature rune spawn. (Do not take anything that you cannot replace / are not willing to lose.)
Greater Demons drop several Rune and Adamant items, which can prove to be extremely profitable.
Recommended Method: similar to the one above for nature runes, but bring an additional 2000+ mind runes and set wind strike as your auto attack spell.)
The caged
Lesser demon
in the
Wizards' Tower
.
In addition to
Vile ashes
which can be sold or used for Prayer training, lesser demons drop a variety of high value items, including uncut gems.
Coins
/
Gold bars
/
Gold ores
/
Gold necklaces
beneath the bank in west
Varrock
.
For players buying runes on the Grand Exchange, this is the easiest method for generating a profit from magic training until Level 55, as the Gold necklaces can be sold for more than the cost of the runes used for casting.
Players can either grab all the items for the fastest exp, or only grab the Gold Ore for the most profit.
Switching Worlds
is recommended to avoid waiting out the long respawn time of the items in the vault.
Level 59+
At level 59, you can begin using
Fire Blast
, while being the strongest available spell in free-to-play, you can also benefit of the
elemental weakness
of
ice giants
and
ice warriors
in the
Asgarnian Ice Dungeon
for a max hit of 32, averaging approximately 70k magic experience per hour at maximum efficiency. They also can be safespotted, so no food is needed and can be trained without interruption.
High alchemy
can also be cast in between Fire Blast for an extra 78k Magic XP per hour, making it a maximum of 148k Magic XP per hour.
If you need to save elemental runes, you can alternately use
Wind Blast
with a
staff of air
, which grants less base XP than Fire Blast but its
magic damage
scales to the damage of Fire Blast at level 59.
Ghosts
and
skeletons
have elemental weakness to
wind spells
, with ghosts taking 50% extra damage and skeletons taking 35% extra damage. High-level ghosts and skeletons can be found in level 4 (Sepulchre of Death) of the
Stronghold of Security
.
Other monsters to kill for experience
The following are alternative monsters to train
Magic
on for experience and drops.
Moss giants
can be effective for gaining
Magic
experience, as they have a 50% weakness to fire. They also drop
big bones
for passive
Prayer
experience, as well as the unique
mossy keys
used to access
Bryophyta
. They can be safespot in
Varrock Sewers
(bring a slash weapon or
knife
), or on
Crandor
for those who have completed
Dragon Slayer I
. Until
combat level
85 moss giants are aggressive and have a max hit of 6; however, they can still be killed safely from safespots without much risk. Like most monsters, they will become
tolerant
when training in the same area longer than 10 minutes, which makes collecting drops between kills completely safe.
Ankou
in
Stronghold of Security
are another popular option for training magic, and they can be safespotted behind skeleton remains in the south-west room of the Sepulchre of Death floor.
Skull sceptre (i)
is recommended to autocast
Crumble Undead
but runes will not be saved. Fortunately, Crumble Undead's cost is cheap compared to
Earth Blast
that does the same maximum damage of 15, making it a cheap magic training method in combat.
Ogress warriors
are also good for good money and experience, although they have high magic and range defence so 60+ Magic is recommended.
Blast spells
are recommended for faster kills as the runes and using
High Level Alchemy
on the rune equipment that ogresses drop can make some of the cost back.
There are
lesser demons
on Karamja
under the volcano
with safespots. They have a 40% weakness to water and drop
vile ashes
which makes them a viable option to train both Prayer and Magic.
Other options include
flesh crawlers
,
spiders
,
giant spiders
,
guards
, and
body golems
(in the
Ruins of Camdozaal
).
Alternative training methods
Cheap methods
Splashing Wind Strike
Splashing Wind Strike with -55 Magic attack bonus (full metal armour and a staff of air) costs 2 coins for 6 xp at 7200 xp per hour, although it will eventually kill most targets until -64 or lower Magic attack bonus is obtained. See AFK training methods.
Splashing Curse
Starting at level 19, one could repeatedly
splash
Curse
to gain
Magic
experience. Casting curse yields 29 experience; approximately 34,000 experience per hour, and a gp/xp of
-0.48
when using a staff of earth.
Note:
if Curse lands on an enemy, it cannot be cast again on that enemy until the effects wear off.
Splashing
bypasses this timer, as the spell never landed on the enemy in the first place.
Recommended equipment:
Staff of earth
with
armour
that provides negative magic bonuses.
Iron armour
or
Green dragonhide armour
Fighting
/
Fancy boots
are good choices.
A magic bonus of -65 attack or lower is strongly recommended.
Some monster options for this type of training include:
Skeletons
Ducks
The
monk of Zamorak
in
Varrock Palace
(Which will allow you to cast curse again after a few seconds, even if you don't splash)
The bear north of Varrock Castle, near the yew trees
The
lesser demon
on the top floor of the
Wizards' Tower
.
The locations above are often in use, so it could be worthwhile finding somewhere else that works best for you.
Low level Alchemy method
At level 21
Magic
you can cast
Low Level Alchemy
on
Iron platebodies
for 31 magic experience per cast. At grand exchange prices, each cast nets
58
. You will need 5214 casts to go from level 21 to level 55, which will take 7 days to buy off the grand exchange with the
Grand Exchange#Buy limits
for platebodies.
Superheating iron ore method
At level 43 Magic and 15 smithing you can cast Superheat Item on Iron Ore for 53 magic experience per cast. This can be potentially profitable if you sell the iron bars. At 3 ticks per cast you can theoretically smelt 2,000 iron ore per hour for a total of 106,000 experience per hour, though actual experience will be lower from using the bank.
High level Alchemy method
At level 55
Magic
you can cast
High Level Alchemy
on various items for 65 magic experience per cast, achieving at most 78,000 experience per hour with nonstop alching. Items that are consistently profitable include
green d'hide bodies
,
mithril platebodies
,
adamant equipment
,
rune equipment
, and more. Players can always make a profit when high alching by checking a spreadsheet or
Grand Exchange Market Watch/Alchemy
to see which items currently offer a profit. Keep in mind that some items have a more restrictive limit as to how many you can buy per 4 hours when purchasing them from the
Grand Exchange
. If you are not an ironman, world 308 is the unofficial high alchemy trading world, where players frequently buy and sell high quantities of profitable high alchemy items directly to one another in the Varrock west bank.
Enchanting amulets
From level 7 onwards, amulets can be enchanted using
enchantment spells
, a click intensive training method which gives great experience per hour rates and can also generate profit. By manually clicking the spell and each amulet in the player's inventory, an amulet can be enchanted every 3 ticks, whereas a player using the spell on an amulet once and waiting will automatically enchant all amulets in their inventory much slower, at a rate of one every 7 ticks. When manually clicking, around 1885 or more amulets can be enchanted every hour.
Elemental staves
can be used to decrease cost when enchanting.

Alternatively, you can also purchase unstrung (u) amulets and
balls of wool
and
string the amulets
yourself.  This is quite fast, has no level or material requirements, provides a little bit of
EXP, is often profitable, and can help if the
GE
market for (strung) amulets is unfavourable.
Expensive methods
Teleporting
Casting teleport spells can be a good way to gain some experience, though it can quickly become expensive. If you do choose this method, start with
Varrock Teleport
at level 25, move on to
Lumbridge Teleport
at level 31, and then cast
Falador Teleport
at level 37. A
staff of air
is recommended as these teleports all require 3 air runes each cast.

Teleport alchemy
Another method involves alchemy and teleportation. To do this method, you will need to cast high alchemy on an item, teleport immediately afterwards, click the high alchemy spell while you are waiting to arrive in the teleport location, and then click the item again as soon as you arrive. This makes sure that you do not lose any potential experience. The recommended teleport location is
Falador
.  Falador teleport gives the most experience of any free to play teleport spells.
AFK methods
Splashing
-64 or lower Magic attack bonus will allow for you to
splash
these spells for approximately 20 minutes while being AFK. This method is 100% safe for HCIM at certain locations such as the top floor of the wizards tower.
