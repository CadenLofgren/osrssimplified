Free-to-play Runecrafting training
This article is about the free-to-play guide. For the members' guide, see
Pay-to-play Runecraft training
.
When crafting runes at a
runic altar
, it is a good idea to wear the corresponding
tiara
in your
head slot
. This acts as an equipable
talisman
, saving an inventory space over a normal talisman. It also allows the player to enter a particular runic altar by left-clicking on the corresponding mysterious ruins, as opposed to having to use the talisman on them, thereby saving time. Talisman tiaras may be purchased from the
Grand Exchange
, from other players, or crafted by a player themselves. To create a talisman tiara, the player must have a plain tiara and the corresponding talisman in their
inventory
, and use the tiara on the altar of that particular talisman. For example, a player who wishes to create an
air tiara
must enter the
Air Altar
ruins, and use the tiara on the altar with an
air talisman
in their inventory. The talisman itself is lost in the process.
All runes craftable by
free-to-play
RuneScape players may be crafted from either
rune essence
,
pure essence
or
Runecrafting cores
.
Body cores
give the most experience, but they are very hard to obtain in large quantities. To obtain enough, one needs to spend most of their combat training by killing
Body Golems
.
For rune or pure essence, using one over the other makes no difference to experience gained or the number of runes crafted per essence. It is therefore recommended to use the cheaper option, which is
pure essence
(
1
each) rather than
rune essence
(
14
each). As a free-to-play player, you will not be able to mine your own pure essence, but you can still purchase it through the Grand Exchange or from other players directly.
Note that
energy potions
(
46.75
per dose) restore 10% run energy with each dose, and using them either at the bank or while running greatly increases experience gained from all of the below methods by 30–50% over just letting your run energy recharge normally (the actual percent experience per hour gained depending on the method and your
Agility
level).

Levels 1–9/14/20:
Air runes
In
free-to-play
, the standard way to begin training
Runecraft
is by crafting
air runes
, which grants 5 Runecraft experience per pure essence or rune essence used (140 experience for an inventory of 28). The
Air Altar
is located just south of
Falador
, with a bank close by. Players with 37
Magic
can use
Falador Teleport
to return back slightly closer to the bank after crafting the runes and speed up experience rates, otherwise simply run back and forth between the altar and bank. Continue to craft air runes until you reach level 9, at which point it is best to move on to crafting
earth runes
.

Levels 9–14/20:
Earth runes
Players with a
Runecraft
level of at least 9 are able to craft
earth runes
, which grant 6.5 experience per pure essence or rune essence used (182 experience for an inventory of 28). The
Earth Altar
is located north-east of
Varrock
, near the
sawmill
. The distance between the altar and bank is a brisk walk away, and
Varrock teleport
allows even faster return to the bank (use an
earth tiara
to save a slot), so you can earn more experience in less time. You will accumulate a decent amount of earth runes, which you may sell or retain as you see fit.

Levels 14–20:
Fire runes
At level 14, it is possible to craft
fire runes
, which grant 7 experience per pure essence or rune essence used (196 experience for an inventory of 28). The
Fire Altar
is located west of the
Emir's Arena
north of
Al Kharid
. The closest bank is the
Al Kharid bank
. (Due to the farther bank distance, fire runes result in less experience per hour than earth runes [Fire giving 6533xp/hr, Earth giving 6911xp/hr]).
Experience needed (14-20): 2,363

Fire runes value:

Levels 20–99:
Body runes
Players with a
Runecraft
level of at least 20 are able to craft
body runes
, which grant 7.5 experience per pure essence or rune essence used (210 experience for an inventory of 28). Body runes are useful for a number of
spells
, such as
Confuse
and
Weaken
, which are often used for low-intensity
Magic
training. Body runes are the highest level runes that
free-to-play
players are able to craft and crafting them grants the highest possible Runecraft experience per GP for free-to-play players. You will accumulate a huge amount of body runes, which you may sell or retain as you see fit.
From levels 20 to 45, one body rune will be created per essence used. From levels 46 to 91, two body runes will be created per essence used. From level 92 onwards, three body runes will be created per essence used.
Experience needed (20–99): 13,029,961
Pure essence or rune essence needed: 1,737,329
Body runes created: 4,335,146

There are several ways to increase the efficiency of body rune crafting.
Using teleports
The closest free-to-play players can teleport to the body rune altar is the teleport to
Barbarian Village
using the
imbued skull sceptre
. 
The closest free-to-play players can teleport to a bank on a non PvP world is using
Falador teleport
to go to the
Falador
west bank. The closest free-to-play players can teleport to a bank on a PvP world is using
Lumbridge teleport
.
Therefore, the fastest method of runecrafting body runes without help of others is to keep law and water runes (or earth runes on the PvP world) and an
imbued skull sceptre
in your inventory as well as equipping a
staff of air
and a
body tiara
(or, equip the imbued skull sceptre and carry air runes, to lower your weight by 2.5 kg).
This would allow players to teleport to
Barbarian Village
with the skull sceptre, run up to the altar to craft the runes, then teleport to
Falador
(or
Lumbridge
on the PvP world) to bank and repeat. This method results in around 20,000 experience per hour (or 25,000 experience per hour in the PvP world) provided the player uses
energy potions
to keep their run energy from depleting.
Be very careful to only take items you're willing to lose to PvP worlds, as you can be
Snared
and
Tele Blocked
and killed when you're not in the Lumbridge safe zone. As long as you aren't Tele Blocked, however, you can teleport yourself back to the safe zone in Lumbridge, and even when carrying fewer runes with you to have a smaller risk, this method is still faster than the non-PVP method.
Using runners
Players who are not an
Ironman
can use essence runners to provide essence to them at the
Body Altar
. This can either be done by paying other players in-game for their services, or by employing alternate accounts. Using the strategy below requires very few clicks per account, making it easy to manage two or three alternate accounts on the same screen running essence. Note that for most clicks, one should click the next spot
before
the player completes the route started by the previous click.
When using 2 extra runners and no energy potions, this gives experience rates of approximately 17,000 experience per hour. Using 3 this can become up to 24,000 experience per hour, and 5 runners give up to 30,000 experience per hour.

Fastest Experience
Levels 1–99: Body tiaras
Talisman
imbued
tiaras
require 1
Runecraft
to make, they range from
air tiaras
to
body tiaras
and each yield 5 times the amount of experience from runecrafting their respective rune. Making one requires a
tiara
and a corresponding talisman to use on the respective altar. This method yields the fastest free-to-play Runecraft experience rates, except for stacked up
runecrafting cores
.
Optimal experience rates of up to 47,000 experience per hour can be attained by using a dangerous
PvP World
, teleporting to
Barbarian Village
using a skull sceptre (i), running to the
Body Altar
, and making the body tiaras.
Lumbridge Teleport
for the closest
bank
and repeat. This requires 31
Magic
, a
staff of air
,
law runes
, and
earth runes
, as well as enough
bone fragments
to recharge the
skull sceptre (i)
.
Energy potions
will be necessary to keep your run
energy
up. It may be more efficient to carry
air runes
instead of using a
staff of air
in order to lower your weight by 2.5 kg at the added cost of spending air runes to teleport.
If avoiding
PvP Worlds
, the closest teleport to a bank is the
Falador Teleport
.
