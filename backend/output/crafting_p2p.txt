Quests for Crafting experience
Starting off
There are plenty of
quests that give Crafting experience
upon completion, which allows the player to skip a lot of early Crafting training. If the player is going to complete them anyway, it is best to do as early as possible since the experience rewards benefit more at lower levels as the training methods are slower.
Fastest experience
Levels 1–20: Leather items
From level 1 to 20, craft the highest-level leather item available.
Leather
currently costs
308
each and all items only require one leather to craft. In order to craft any leather items, you need a
needle
and some
thread
. Since each thread is good for around 5 uses, to get to level 20 with this method, you will need around 50
thread
.

This will require a total of 217 leather, for a total cost of

. Every leather item is created in 3 ticks (1.8 seconds), so the total creation time for all 217 leather items is 651 ticks (390.6 seconds).
Levels 20–62/77/99: Cutting gems
Cutting (uncut) gems offers the fastest experience up to level 77. However, cutting dragonstones is much more expensive compared to the lower-level gems, so it is recommended to keep cutting diamonds until level 62 and continue with fire battlestaves. Depending on the prices, it may be worthwhile to also skip cutting diamonds, and cut rubies until level 58 and continue with earth battlestaves.
Even though onyxes offer faster experience, they are not viable due to incredibly high cost and limited supply.
The experience rates and costs are shown in the table below. The rates assume players cut 2,780 gems per hour.

Levels 54–77/99: Battlestaves
Crafting battlestaves offers relatively fast experience and is usually cheaper compared to other methods. While this method is usually relatively cheap, buying the supplies requires a lot of capital.
Fire and air battlestaves have comparable experience rates to green and blue d'hide bodies, respectively, so choose based on the Grand Exchange prices. Green and blue d'hide bodies require a lot less capital.
Players who have completed tiers of the
Varrock Diary
may also purchase noted battlestaves daily from
Zaff
for a reduced price. This will save
1,230
per battlestaff compared to purchasing them from the Grand Exchange.
Crafting d'hide bodies becomes considerably faster at level 77 and even more so at level 84, but air battlestaves remain as a good cheaper alternative.
The experience rates shown in the table below assume 2,450 battlestaves crafted per hour. Expect lower rates if idling. With perfect banking, it is possible to craft up to 2,625 battlestaves per hour.
High Level Alchemy
can be cast on the battlestaves later to reduce costs while also gaining passive
Magic
experience. If including the time taken to cast High Level Alchemy, only 800 battlestaves can be made and alched per hour.

Levels 63/77–99: D'hide bodies
Crafting d'hide bodies becomes the fastest viable training method from level 77 onwards. Players can begin crafting green d'hide bodies at level 63, or blue d'hide bodies at level 71 as an alternative method to cutting gems or crafting battlestaves.
Use the
costume needle
to craft 9 d'hide bodies per inventory. The player can obtain one from the
Costumer
in
Aldarin
after completing
Death on the Isle
. Without the costume needle the player will need
thread
to craft d'hide bodies, which only allows making 8 d'hide bodies per inventory and will lower experience rates slightly.
Turn on deposit lock in the bank menu to bank efficiently. This allows the player to only deposit d'hide bodies with the 'Deposit inventory' button without depositing the costume needle.
The player can use
tick manipulation
to start the crafting process one tick faster. To do this, have an alternative account to lure aggressiveness of a gnome at the
Gnome Stronghold south bank
. Position the gnome so that they stand on an adjacent tile to the bank booth. Equip a shortbow without ammo and set the attack option to Rapid. When banking, quickly attempt to attack the gnome before using the needle on a leather. This will skip the stall from making the first item when done correctly, which will increase experience rates slightly.
Green and blue d'hide bodies offer comparable experience rates to fire and air battlestaves, respectively. Choose whichever is cheaper. However, green and blue d'hide bodies require a lot less capital. Black d'hide bodies offer the fastest experience but they are typically much more expensive compared to other methods, so look into cheaper alternatives if seeking to save money.
The experience rates in the table below assume good banking and paying attention. Expect lower rates if idling or making mistakes with banking. With tick manipulation, players can craft up to 1,860 d'hide bodies per hour. Without tick manipulation, it is possible to craft up to 1,800 d'hide bodies per hour when using the costume needle.
High Level Alchemy
can be cast on the d'hide bodies later to reduce costs while also gaining passive
Magic
experience. The High Level Alchemy prices assume a
staff of fire
or equivalent is used. If including the time taken to cast high alchemy, only about 700 d'hide bodies can be made and alched per hour.

Other methods
Levels 1–83/99: Molten glass
Blowing
molten glass
with a
glassblowing pipe
offers very slow experience rates, but it requires little attention and a low amount of capital. Most low-level items are not viable due to high cost, but certain higher-level ones, such as unpowered orbs, may be very cheap depending on the prices. Consider making money through other means and training with faster methods, such as cutting low-level gems.

Levels 5–99: Crafting jewellery
Starting at level 5, players can begin crafting gold jewellery using a gold bar and the appropriate mould at a furnace. The type of jewellery crafted depends on the mould used, with rings, necklaces, amulets, and bracelets being the primary options.
The best location for crafting is Prifddinas, as it features the shortest distance between a bank and a furnace. If you do not have access to
Prifddinas
,
Edgeville
is the next best option. Another alternative is the
Shilo Village
furnace, which is even closer to the bank than Edgeville’s but requires a 20gp fee per use (players can deposit bulk payments in the coffer for convenience).
If available, wearing weight-reducing clothing will help reduce run energy drain, making trips more efficient. At higher crafting levels, certain jewellery items, such as
dragonstone
can be profitable, though they tend to be traded in lower quantities.
Zenyte
and
Onyx
jewellery were not included because their profit margins are often inaccurate, they would also require an immense cash down to buy in bulk.
Zenytes
are also just rarely sold on the Grand Exchange.
The following rates used for experience per hour are 1400 for a gem and metal bar, 1600 for just metal bars, or 960 for a gem and metal bar with stringing.

Levels 26–46/99: Crafting drift nets
Drift nets
can be crafted from 2
jute fibre
each. About 1,000 can be made per hour for 60,000 experience per hour and
534,000
coins per hour when using the
loom
and
bank chest
at
Fossil Island
's
Museum Camp
. This is better experience per hour compared to glassblowing until 46 Crafting, which unlocks
unpowered orbs
. It nets
9.71
coins per experience gained. This is a potential
money making method
, though check Grand Exchange prices and volume before attempting it.
Levels 61–99: Casting Superglass Make
Players who have 77
Magic
(can be
boosted
) and have completed
Lunar Diplomacy
, which requires 61 Crafting along with other requirements (cannot
boost
from lower levels to complete), can cast
Superglass Make
with the
lunar spellbook
. With Superglass Make, players can convert an inventory of
buckets of sand
with
soda ash
,
seaweed
,
giant seaweed
(recommended), or
swamp weed
into molten glass, granting 78 Magic experience as well as Crafting experience (180 Crafting experience per inventory with 18 buckets of sand and 3 giant seaweed or 130 Crafting experience per inventory with 13 buckets of sand with 13 of any other compatible item) and players can
profit
from selling molten glass or use the created molten glass for additional Crafting experience without much of a loss.
For this training method, astral runes (2 astral runes per cast), 3 giant seaweed, and 18 buckets of sand will be needed per inventory while equipped with either a
smoke battlestaff
or an air battlestaff with
tome of fire
. On average, it will make 1.3 glass for regular seaweed, soda ash, or swamp weed, or up to 1.6 glass per sand with giant seaweed.
With moderate focus, 600 casts per hour is achievable, with up to 850 being attainable at peak efficiency, achieving 108,000–153,000 Crafting and 46,800–66,300 Magic experience per hour from giant seaweed while making a good amount of profit. Withdraw 18 buckets of sand and 3 giant seaweed, close the bank, cast Superglass Make, and then bank them within a few ticks before the end of the animation. For the best experience and money-making rates, ignore any dropped glass, as this will still yield 0.15 extra molten glass per bucket of sand compared to regular seaweed or other compatible item.
Level 52-99 Fixing goblin lamps in Dorgesh-Kaan
Map of lamps in Dorgesh-Kaan
Lamps
can be fixed in
Dorgesh-Kaan
for both
crafting
and
firemaking
experience. This requires completion of
The Lost Tribe
and level 52 crafting and firemaking. Each lamp requires a
light orb
to fix. The light orbs can be purchased on the
Grand Exchange
or crafted yourself, however crafting the complete light orbs requires level 87 crafting.
Around ten lamps will be broken at any one time, and are unique to each player; each player will see different lamps around Dorgesh-Kaan as broken.
Fixing the lamps yields an average of 550 crafting and 550 firemaking experience. The player instead receives an additional of 174 crafting experience per lamp if crafting the light orbs — 70 for blowing the glass and 104 for adding the wire, though this takes longer.
The player receives 500 firemaking and 500 crafting experience each time a lamp is fixed. For every 50 lamps fixed, the player will receive an additional 2,500 experience in both crafting and firemaking. Upon fixing a lamp, should the player still be carrying additional light orbs afterwards, they will be notified whether there is another lamp in need of fixing nearby. This will be accompanied by a flashing arrow on their minimap if so. Light orbs can be thieved from the chests in Dorgesh-kaan, but in relatively low numbers.
Skilled players can reach 130,000 crafting experience and 100,000 firemaking experience per hour, if making the light orbs.
While still learning, players should expect as low as 90,000 crafting experience per hour.
The
average chest
and
rich chest
are both found in high numbers on the route and can grant additional light orbs. The chests grant 200 thieving experience and 650 thieving experience per successful attempt, respectively. This will mean the player gains less crafting experience, but more thieving experience and extra
cave goblin wire
from both chest types, and
empty light orbs
and
light orbs
from the rich chests.
Items required
Light orbs
filling most of the inventory, with more in the bank. These can be bought on the grand exchange.
Empty light orbs
or
molten glass
with a
glassblowing pipe
if making your own light orbs. This requires 87 crafting. The player will also need
cave goblin wire
for each light orb, which can be thieved nearby at the
wire machine
with 44 thieving.
Stamina potion
and low-weight equipment such as the
Graceful outfit
. The
ring of endurance
may be beneficial here.
Lockpicks
if thieving the chests
Making your own light orbs
See the
light orb
page for more detailed information.
Players should take an inventory of empty light orbs to the
wire machine
. Either craft the empty light orbs ahead of time or take an inventory of molten glass and craft it while running to the wire machine. Once there, fill all of the light orbs with cave wire. Then, either work clockwise or counterclockwise around the city fixing lamps. After fixing a lamp at the bank, grab more items from the bank and start again. Every time the player fixes a lamp, the game will indicate where a nearby broken lamp is. Because only one lamp location is given, players should also keep an eye out for other nearby lamps that can also be repaired and prioritise lamps in an order that requires the least amount of backtracking. Whenever there are no nearby lamps, using a
Dorgesh-kaan sphere
to teleport to a random location in the city can help to reach another broken lamp quickly.
Levels 83–99: Cutting amethyst
Cutting
amethyst
into ranging material with a chisel will often yield very small losses (or even profits) while also granting more experience than glassblowing, making it a viable method for those who are willing to sacrifice the speed of other methods for cheaper (or profitable) Crafting experience.
