This article provides information about effective ways to train
Attack
,
Strength
,
Defence
, and
Hitpoints
through
melee
combat
.
This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is
Levels 20 to 30
, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more
food
or use food that heals more.

General training notes
The
Waterfall Quest
will get you to both 30 Attack and Strength if completed at level 3 combat.
Since experience rates are largely influenced by
Strength
level and
strength bonus
, it is optimal to maintain balanced
melee stats
until reaching the minimum requirements for the best-in-slot
weapon
and
equipment
. After this, prioritizing Strength until
99
, followed by
Attack
and finally
Defence
, will result in the fastest route to max melee stats. For example, when training in the
Nightmare Zone
with
Obsidian Armour
, a
Berserker Necklace
, and the
Toktz-Xil-Ak
, Attack and Defence should remain at 60 until reaching 99 Strength for optimal experience gains.
Strength can be trained without training Hitpoints with
barbarian fishing
and at the
Blast Furnace
pump, which requires 30 Strength.
Defence can be trained by using
Ancient Magicks
on
defensive
or
chinchompas
on Long fuse against
Maniacal monkeys
for more experience per hour than using melee.
Players can complete
Slayer
tasks to train Slayer while simultaneously training
combat
stats. This is an effective combat training method as well as providing profit in most cases.
When fighting dangerous monsters it is suggested to bring a
teleportation
tablet
or
if your
Magic
level is high enough, teleportation
runes
in order to quickly escape. Note that a tablet can be more easily clicked from your inventory and takes up less space than runes for a teleport spell.
To start off, it is strongly recommended to complete
quests that give a lot of melee experience
. This allows players to wear much better equipment and have much higher damage output when they start training.
A lot of the quests are quick to complete and only have a few requirements. Most of them include boss fights, which can be made trivial with
protection prayers
, and many of the bosses can be safespotted with Magic or Ranged. It is strongly recommended to complete
Witch's House
to get Hitpoints higher.
The recommended quests for early melee experience are listed in the table below. Completing all of them would give the player a total of 65,275 Attack, 27,537.5 Strength, and 15,300 Defence experience. This would get the player up to level 45 Attack, level 37 Strength, and level 31 Defence without doing any melee training.

Fastest Experience
Levels 1-30: Questing
Completing the
Waterfall Quest
at level 1 Attack and Strength will instantly bring the player to level 30 in strength and attack.  This quest has no requirements, making it the fastest way to train a brand-new account to these levels, skipping much of the slow low-level training. However, there are several aggressive and hard-hitting monsters during the quest, so players may alternatively want to train some
Defence
and
Hitpoints
levels to make the quest safer. Completing the Recommended quests will get the player up to level 45 Attack, level 37 Strength, and level 31 Defence.

Advantages
Disadvantages
The best monster for training at medium and high combat levels.
Has infinite health with low
Defence
and
Attack
ability, meaning you won't need much food if any
Can be mined for gems by the 16 players who dealt the most damage.
Switches locations after 10 minutes; must be pursued by entering a nearby cave.
Gives slightly less experience per hit compared to normal monsters (87.5% of the normal amount), though this is made up for by the fact there is no downtime between killing monsters as there is with the other crabs.

Other methods
You may use these if the above methods are too crowded or otherwise not available. However, they are not as good as the other methods.
It is not recommended to train melee for profit at low levels. It is usually better to train with
crabs
,
Slayer
, or the
Nightmare Zone
and do something else to make money for overall more efficient play. For example, killing
Hobgoblins
for two hours will give both less money and less experience than spinning flax for one hour and training on crabs for one hour. Low-level players looking to make money for early gear should check out the
Money-making guide
.
Here are some easy options for training melee if you do want to kill monsters for profit and still get decent experience rates.

Fastest melee XP in the game at higher levels with the hard combat achievements completed, as XP is gained both from combat and commendation points simultaneously
No competition from other players - in fact this method benefits from having more people participating
Stats get restored at the end of each game, allowing for frequent use of special attacks and negating the need for prayer potions
Earns a small amount of coins
Depends on having enough people playing for optimal XP rates
Requires a high amount of attention as the games move quickly

Advantages
Disadvantages
Rune dragons are the most profitable non-boss monster a high level player can kill for profit with melee while not paying too much attention
Drops a
runite bar
and
dragon bones
on every kill, as well as frequently dropping valuable rune and dragon equipment
Has a chance of dropping several valuable rare items including the
dragon limbs
Is close to the

Requires very expensive gear and completion of
Dragon Slayer II
The dragons deal heavy damage even with max stats and the best items in the game. Players must keep their health above 60 to avoid dying to a ranged attack and melee attack combo
Rune dragons can heal themselves with their unblockable special attack. If the player is unlucky or weak the dragons will heal faster than they can be killed
The player must frequently bank to get lots of high-level food and potions to fight the dragons effectively
Their high defence yields below average experience rates
At this point in their account, players should have access to better money makers such as
Vorkath
and
Zulrah
Equipment choice
Items will be listed in order of how much they increase general melee damage per second. In nearly all cases, optimising for offensive stats is more effective than optimising for defensive or balanced stats, especially when fighting the low-offence, high-hp monsters on this list. In addition, optimising for Strength is usually better than optimising for accuracy except against high-Defence monsters.

Torva or Oathplate may be more effective depending on the NPC's defensive stats and attack style used.
Three of these items provide the same Strength bonus of +3, so choose between them based on their other stats such as their Defence or availability. Note that these Strength-boosting helmets are almost always better than helmets that only provide accuracy, such as the
warrior helm
, for general training.
When training
Slayer
, a
Slayer helm
(or
black mask
) will always provide the greatest damage increase over any of these.

If the player does not have access to any of these, an
obsidian cape
or a
Cape of Accomplishment
can be used instead due to their moderate Defence bonuses, however, they will not increase damage. The
Ardougne cloak
also provides a stab accuracy bonus and a moderate Prayer bonus.

Depending on your stats, for monsters with low Defence, an
amulet of Strength
can be better than an
amulet of power
,
amulet of glory
, or even an
amulet of fury
.
When fighting
undead
monsters and not using a
Slayer helmet
, the
salve amulet
and its upgraded version the
salve amulet (e)
are the best neck-slot items.

When fighting dragons, a Dragonfire shield is the best melee offhand item due to its ability to block dragonfire while having high Strength and Defence bonuses. IMPORTANT: The "Uncharged" Dragonfire shield has about 1/3 the defensive characteristics of the charged shield. If the dragonfire protection and high Defence are not needed, defenders are better due to their accuracy bonuses.
As defenders require access to the
Warriors' Guild
and thus a combined Attack and Strength level of 130 (for example, level 65 in both), the
Toktz-ket-xil
or
dragonfire shield
should be used until that requirement is met. If the required Defence levels for those items (60 and 75 respectively) aren't met, a
book of war
can be used.

Rings should be
imbued
as soon as possible
. Also note that the Warrior, Tyrannical, and Treasonous rings only benefit one attacking style each, while the Brimstone ring benefits all melee combat. If the player cannot afford any of these rings, a
ring of wealth
is a decent alternative to help improve
rare drop table
rolls and pick up
coins
, but it does not increase damage. Low level players can benefit from a
ring of recoil
, as 10% + 1 of the damage received by the player (rounded down) is dealt to the attacker, and always recoils at least 1 damage when the player is hit.
Weapon choice
Choosing a weapon
In most cases, choosing a weapon with an attack speed of 2.4 seconds (4 ticks) will be the best choice for dealing the highest damage per second. Slower weapons almost always give less experience overall against low-defence monsters, even if they do more damage per hit, but may deal more against high-defence monsters.
Monster vulnerability may cause certain weapons to perform better than their stats suggest. For example, most
dragons
are weak to Stab, making the otherwise weaker
zamorakian hasta
a better choice than the
abyssal whip
when fighting them. Check a monster's wiki page to see its defensive bonuses and consider picking a weapon it is weak to.
Training weapons in order of effectiveness
Note: All one-handed weapons in this table will have their stats displayed as if they were paired with an
avernic defender
to make a fair comparison to two-handed weapons.
Note: Some
Crush
weapons in this table will have stats displayed as paired with the
inquisitor's armour
set and its respective
defender
, if applicable, to more easily showcase the enhancements the set effect offers to weapons that deliver
Crush
attacks.
If you do not have access to a shield at all, such as if you do not want to risk an additional item in the
Wilderness
or you have not yet unlocked the requirements for certain offhand equipment, some fast two-handed weapons like the
Saradomin sword
become worth using.
The weapons listed here with level requirements of less than 70 Attack will include the
dragon defender
bonuses instead of the Avernic one, while weapons with a requirement of less than 60 will not include the bonuses of a defender, as it is unlikely that someone using one of these low level weapons would have access to one due to the 130 Attack+Strength requirement. As noted above, players with 60 Defence without access to defenders should be using the
Toktz-ket-xil
.

When combined with the

. However, it must be charged with
crystal shards
, which can be obtained from either doing various activities around
Prifddinas
or from exchanging certain crystal seeds with
Amrod
. This effectively makes the sword require
Song of the Elves
to use. Each shard grants 100 charges; the weapon can store up to 20,000 charges and loses one charge with each hit (regardless of whether the hit is successful or not). One can bring it and 1,000 crystal shards to a
singing bowl
to make
blade of Saeldor (c)
, which is non-degradable and non-tradeable (requires level 82
Crafting
and

While it is the fourth strongest one handed four tick weapon in the game, the tentacle's cost per attack, of
149.10
, makes training far more expensive, but provides a boost of +8
Slash

. The costs adds up to

This is the most common training weapon, especially considering that it is affordable and does not degrade. The whip is the second-strongest non-degradable Attack and Defence training weapon in the game. Using this weapon on
Controlled
is an easy, but slower way to reach 99
Attack
,
Strength
, and
Defence
since all the experience is spread across these three skills. One disadvantage of the abyssal whip is that it cannot train Strength without training Attack and Defence at the same time, so
pures
should avoid using it to train.

This is the second-best non-degradable Strength training weapon. It is very useful when fighting a monster with a vulnerability to Crush weapons, such as
Revenants
and
Vet'ion
. However, the fairly high cost and being only a slight upgrade over more affordable weapons make it a less popular choice for strength training.
If you can afford to combine this weapon with the
inquisitor's armour
set, the significantly improved accuracy and slightly improved damage make this weapon even more powerful.

This weapon is not generally chosen for everyday training due to only being able to train on controlled or defensive. It is both weaker and more expensive than the abyssal whip. It is primarily used against monsters with a weakness to Stab, such as all types of
dragons
. It also has a decent Crush bonus, so it can be used as an alternative to the Abyssal bludgeon for fighting Crush-weak enemies like
Kalphites
and Vet'ion.

The fifth-best one-handed Strength training weapon. It is more accurate with a defender than the next-best Strength training weapon, the Saradomin sword, but has lower Strength. This makes the staff better against high-defence monsters, but it is much less affordable. Also, it is strictly worse than the
abyssal dagger
, which should usually be used instead unless a slash weapon is needed.

The Saradomin sword is a much more affordable Strength training weapon than anything above it on this list. Against lower-defence monsters such as
Yaks
, the Saradomin sword will on average do higher damage per second than the
staff of the dead
due to its higher Strength. However, this sword's lack of a shield and the staff's magic capabilities and melee accuracy make the staff usually more desirable if you can afford it.

The zombie axe has a

slightly more powerful and

accurate.

The
Sarachnis cudgel
is generally not favoured for training due to its marginal advantages over the
dragon scimitar
and its requirement of 5 additional Attack levels to wield. Compared to higher-tier weapons requiring 70+ Attack, like the Saradomin sword and staff of the dead, it falls short in melee
Strength
. Nonetheless, the cudgel may have the upper hand in rare situations where the target is susceptible to Crush attacks.
The
inquisitor's armour
set enhances the
Crush Style
attacks of the
Sarachnis cudgel
, increasing both power and accuracy.

This weapon is on par with the dragon scimitar as the best training weapon for all attack styles at level 60 Attack, requiring no charging or quest completion. When charged with
revenant ether
, it grants a 50% boost in melee accuracy and damage against
NPCs
in the
Wilderness
, often surpassing other weapons in training speed if used there. However, it is notably more expensive than the dragon scimitar and carries the risk of losing money through charges if the user is
killed
in the Wilderness. Moreover, when used with any of the
defenders
, the mace's accuracy is slightly inferior to that of the dragon scimitar, as defenders tend to offer greater offensive bonuses for
Stab
/
Slash
than for
Crush
.
The inquisitor's armour set
significantly
enhances the accuracy and damage of
Viggora's chainmace
by providing a buff to its base Crush and Strength bonus. This amplifies the chainmace's passive 50% boost in accuracy and damage against Wilderness
NPCs
, particularly when combined with either the
salve amulet
or the
Slayer helmet
. This is not advised though as this would be a significant risk.

This is tied for the best training weapon for all attack styles at level 60 with the Viggora's chainmace. In addition, the dragon scimitar is a
much
cheaper alternative to all of the weapons listed above, making it very popular even among some high level players. For Attack and Defence training, it should be replaced with the abyssal whip as soon as one can afford and equip it.

A viable alternate training weapon before being able to use the dragon scimitar since Monkey Madness I is a much longer and harder quest than

. It should be noted that the
dragon longsword
attacks 1 game tick slower than the dragon scimitar, making it less damage per second than the dragon scimitar for training.

Other equipment options
Obsidian equipment + Berserker necklace
Wearing the
obsidian platebody
,
obsidian platelegs
, and the
obsidian helmet
gives a 10% damage and accuracy bonus to melee
obsidian weapons
. Wearing the
berserker necklace
also gives another 20% damage bonus to Obsidian weapons. Combining all four of these items with the
Toktz-xil-ak
(Obsidian sword) can give faster experience rates than anything in the table above against low-defence monsters, such as those in the
Nightmare Zone
. However, the set has below-average Defence and does not allow the use of a
Slayer helmet
. If the player cannot use all five items, they should not be using the
Toktz-xil-ak
.
Void knight equipment
Wearing the
Void melee helm
with the full
Void Knight equipment
set gives a 10% melee damage and accuracy bonus. This bonus accuracy makes it good against certain high-defence monsters like the
Corporeal Beast
. It is a good alternative for players with 42 combat stats who do not have access to high-Strength gear. However, this set gives less Strength than other melee equipment and has significantly lower melee and ranged Defence, making it usually worse for training than high-strength gear.
Dharok the Wretched's equipment
Wearing a full set of
Dharok the Wretched's equipment
gives the set effect of increasing the player's damage the lower their remaining Hitpoints are. Using a
dwarven rock cake
or
locator orb
the player can intentionally keep their health at 1 hp while using
protection prayers
to block all forms of damage. If the player has a source of Prayer or damage block, such as by using
Prayer potions
,
absorptions
(Nightmare Zone only), or an altar, the player can safely use the set's effect to deal very high amounts of damage and gain fast experience. However, the set degrades after 15 hours of use and must be repaired to keep its stats.
Guthan the Infested's equipment
Wearing a full set of
Guthan the Infested's equipment
gives the set effect of a 25% chance to heal the player by the damage dealt. This set deals less damage than some of the best options on the list, but it allows players to train for long periods without banking to heal. Players can bring the four pieces in their inventory, train on their normal high-strength equipment, and switch to the Guthan's equipment only when their health gets low. Popular monsters for this tactic are
gargoyles
,
nechryael
, and
bandits
. However, the set degrades after 15 hours of use and must be repaired to keep its stats.
