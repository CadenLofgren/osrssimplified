Construction training
Training
Construction
can be quite costly, but it has significant utility throughout
Old School RuneScape
including for transportation, combat, clue scrolls, and socializing.

Starting off
To start off, the
Daddy's Home
miniquest
grants a total of 944 Construction experience as well as a
crate of Construction supplies
. This will get the player up from level 1 to 8. Players that are going for
Angler's outfit
should start at
Fishing Trawler
. 100 trips would require a minimum of 1000
swamp paste
, or 5100 if gaining max points. 5100 fixes would also provide 25,500
construction
experience, equivalent to level 36. Alternatively, purchase a
player-owned house
from any
estate agent
for
1,000
. The house will have two rooms – a
parlour
and a
garden
– and no furniture apart from the
exit portal
in the garden.
A players'
house portal
is located in
Rimmington
by default, but can be
moved
for a fee. It is recommended to have level 40
Magic
to be able to cast
Teleport to House
. Alternatively, use
teleport to house tablets
.
Construction is typically trained by repeatedly building and removing various furniture inside the player-owned house. To build furniture, enter the player-owned house in
building mode
or enable it through
settings
while inside. Players will need a
saw
and a
hammer
to build
items
.
General information and tips
Hotkeys
Using the trick to build and remove without moving the mouse after right clicking.
To minimise mouse movement, use
resizable mode
and zoom all the way in. Widen the game client slightly so that there is some space between the chat box and the right hand side control panel. Position the
hotspot
you want to train at the bottom of the screen. Then position the mouse over the hotspot and slightly higher than the report button. When done right, the build and remove options should be in the same spot as the right-click.
When building various items in the player-owned house, there will be a number hotkey for fast Construction training. When removing the said item(s), press the "1" key to immediately remove it.
Managing inventory while training
Phials
From level 1 to 40, have the player-owned house in
Rimmington
. Bring noted planks in the inventory and unnote them at
Phials
for 5 coins each. This is faster than fetching the planks from a bank. If available, wear
weight-reducing clothing
to reduce run energy consumption while getting more planks. When entering back to the house, right-click the house portal to enter the house in building mode.
Servants
At level 40, hire a
servant
from the
Servants' Guild
in East
Ardougne
to unnote more planks. To be able to hire a servant, the player's house must have at least two
bedrooms
with beds constructed in each one. Using a servant is much faster than unnoting planks at Phials. This costs money, but the increased speed is well worth the extra cost.
Use the
Butler
from level 40 to 50, and the
Demon butler
from level 50 onwards. Using lower-level servants is not recommended, because all other servants below the human butler are slower than manually using Phials.
Servants will request a payment after 8 services completed. At lower levels, players will need to have coins in their inventory to pay them. At level 58, build the
servant's money bag
in one of the bedrooms and put coins in it to automatically pay the servant while they perform tasks. This also skips the dialogue of the servant requesting payment, which will save time.
Efficiency
Main article:
Efficiency
Because almost all Construction training methods are available to players as early as level 52, a main differentiator between training methods and plank choice is
cost
(coins per experience) and
speed
(experience per hour). At current prices:
Oak planks
cost
390 coins
each and grant 60 XP when used in a POH (
6.5 coins
per XP).
Mahogany planks
cost
1,980 coins
each and grant 140 XP when used in a POH (
14.14 coins
per XP).
Assuming the best and most efficient training methods you are capable of are:
550,000 XP per hour with oak planks (9166 planks per hour)
1,100,000 XP per hour with mahogany planks (7856 planks per hour)
Then the total investment required to gain 1.1 million XP is either:
2 hours with oak planks, at a cost of
7,149,480 coins
for 18332 planks plus
954,792 coins
for servants.
1 hour with mahogany planks, at a cost of
15,554,880 coins
for 7856 planks plus
409,167 coins
for servants.
That means in order to save 1 hour of time, it costs
7,859,775 coins
. This would only ever be worthwhile if you can feasibly earn
more
than this amount per hour with your time, or simply prefer doing other activities enough to accept the cost associated with saving that time.
The
carpenter's outfit
provides 2.5% extra experience, which can help to save money, but will generally not save time given that most Construction training methods provide very high experience per hour. If time is the main concern, the outfit is not worth getting for level 99 unless training via Mahogany Homes.
Prices
Planks
are the primary material for training, and using them costs money. Buy the planks from the
Grand Exchange
. While making planks from logs can save money, especially with the
Plank Make
spell, it does not give any Construction experience and is therefore considered simply a
money making method
for normal accounts.
There are four tiers of planks:
regular
,
oak
,
teak
, and
mahogany
, each with increasing cost and experience gained from using it. Planks yield the same amount of experience per plank regardless of what furniture is built, except for the
mounted mythical cape
and some low-level furniture which use regular planks. As such, use the highest-tier planks for the fastest experience rates, or look into cheaper alternatives if trying to save money.

boost
+8 for the

Fastest experience
Passive experience
Experience gained through non-Construction activities can be considered "free" and help skip early levels:
Fishing Trawler
provides 5 Construction experience per fixed leak while earning a full
angler's outfit
. Outfit luck varies widely but on average, 11,220 Construction experience will be earned assuming 44 games and full contribution points per game.
Wintertodt
provides a steady amount of Construction experience equal to 4x current Construction level. As with
other
multiplier methods, this is quite effective at gaining new levels roughly from level 4-27 before it slows down considerably.
Vale Totems
provides Construction experience equal to the current level for each totem crafted.
At level 30 Construction, players can turn
long
and
curved
bones in to
Barlak
for both Construction experience and some coins. He can be found inside the city of
Dorgesh-Kaan
, which requires completion of
Death to the Dorgeshuun
to access. These bones are somewhat rare and are primarily dropped by monsters which also drop
big bones
.
Levels 1–33: Starting off
The table below shows the furniture and materials needed to reach level 33.
Regular planks require using nails. Use
steel nails
or better, as lower-tier nails bend more often. Start using oak planks at level 15, as they are faster to use than regular planks as they do not require using nails.

Levels 33–52/74: Oak larders
From level 33 to 52, build
oak larders
in the
Kitchen
. Oak larders require 8
oak planks
to build, and they grant 480 experience each.
Players can gain up to around 480,000 experience per hour from level 50 onwards. If planning to keep using oak planks for cheaper experience, switch to
oak dungeon doors
(
listed below
) at level 74 for faster rates.

Levels 52–99: Mahogany furniture
Building mahogany furniture becomes the fastest viable training method at level 52. It is very expensive, so look into cheaper alternatives (such as teak or oak furniture) if trying to save money. Players can gain up to around 900,000 experience per hour with mahogany tables, or 1,100,000 experience per hour with gnome benches.
Mahogany tables
in the
dining room
are the fastest way to use
mahogany planks
until level 77. Each mahogany table requires 6 mahogany planks and gives 840 experience. The optimal method is to build 3 tables and remove 2 tables in the time the
demon butler
takes to fetch 24 planks from the bank (22 ticks/inventory cycle on a consistently low-ping world). In higher-ping worlds, it is recommended to remove 3 tables and build 2 tables (23 ticks/inventory) or build 2 tables and remove 2 tables (24 ticks/inventory) while the demon butler fetches planks. The 22-tick inventory cycle is shown below:

With good attention, players can easily expect to go from level 52 to level 77 within 2 hours.
At level 77, players can build
gnome benches
in the
superior garden
, which offers the best possible experience rate of just over 1,100,000 experience per hour. Gnome benches require 6 mahogany planks and give 840 experience, just like the tables; however, benches can be built and removed in alternation since the two hotspots are adjacent to one another.
The method for building gnome benches is as follows:
Stand on the inner tile between both bench hotspots with 18 Mahogany Planks.
Call servant and send the Demon Butler to bring 24 Mahogany Planks from your bank.
On the next tick, click to remove the built bench.
On the next tick, click to build on the empty hotspot.
Every time you build a bench, repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of planks.
The Demon Butler will return and restock your planks.
Build and remove one bench using the new supplies before sending him back to the bank (returning to step 2).
This method takes advantage of the fact that removing furniture takes only one tick and can occur simultaneously with opening the build interface to save time. This allows for a third build rotation while the Demon Butler is collecting supplies from the bank, as compared with only two rotations if building and removing on only one hotspot.

Other methods
Levels 1–99: Mahogany Homes
Mahogany Homes
is a cheaper and less click-intensive alternative to the faster methods. Players work as a contractor for the Mahogany Homes company, repairing and replacing furniture in client NPCs' houses throughout
Falador
,
Varrock
,
East Ardougne
, and
Hosidius
.
To begin, speak to
Amy
in Falador after acquiring a
player-owned house
. Have her assign a construction contract, travel to the client's house, refurbish the marked furniture, and talk to the client to finish. Subsequent contracts can also be assigned by
Marlo
in Varrock,
Ellie
in East Ardougne, or
Angelo
in Hosidius. They are found in the same buildings as the cities' respective
estate agents
.
Building the furniture requires the respective planks for the contract tier and
steel bars
. A hammer and a saw is required to build the furniture.
Nails
are not required. For optimal rates, players will need
teleports
to all four cities, such as
teleport tablets
or
runes
, and a charged
Xeric's talisman
for Hosidius.
Completing a contract will reward the player with Construction experience and
Carpenter points
. The points can be exchanged for additional
rewards
, such as the
Carpenter's outfit
, the
plank sack
, and
supply crates
. Additionally, the client will offer the player a cup of tea, replenishing their
run energy
to 100% after completing the contract.
Estimated costs for this training method are
-2.18
GP/XP for Novice contracts,
-3.13
GP/XP for Adept contracts, and
-5.82
GP/XP for Expert contracts (see chart below).

Levels 50–99: Mounted mythical capes
Mounted mythical capes
are a cheaper alternative to mahogany or other teak furniture. They require 3 teak planks each along with a
mythical cape
. The cape is returned after removing the furniture. Each mounted mythical cape gives 370 experience, granting more experience per
teak plank
than other teak furniture. However, oak larders offer faster experience and are usually similar in cost.
Building mounted mythical capes requires completion of
Dragon Slayer II
, which requires having at least level 50 Construction. In case of mistakes, have an equipable item in the inventory as players cannot remove a mounted mythical cape if they have a full inventory of planks.
Send the demon butler away with 6 planks still in your inventory.
Remove and build 2 mounted mythical capes.
After the second remove, wait 1 tick and the butler will return with 24 planks.
Players can gain up to around 430,000 experience per hour with maximum efficiency. Expect lower rates if making mistakes.

Levels 66–74/99: Teak garden benches
Building
teak garden benches
is the fastest way to use teak planks. They require 6 teak planks to build and give 540 experience each. This method is similar to gnome benches, offering slower (albeit still relatively fast) experience while being cheaper. As with gnome benches, this method requires precise timing and accurate clicks. Any mistakes will lower the experience rates considerably, and players may get faster rates with other options.
Players can gain a maximum of around 700,000 experience per hour building garden benches at level 66 with perfect execution, however most players should expect to gain 500,000 to 600,000 experience per hour. With good execution, it should take roughly an hour to reach level 74, at which point players may consider building
oak dungeon doors
instead, which offer slightly slower experience rates at the benefit of potentially reduced cost. Likewise, players who wish to gain faster experience may find it better to spend extra money on building mahogany furniture instead, as this would save around 7–8 hours on the way to level 99 depending on the method and efficiency.

Levels 74–99: Oak dungeon doors
The servant is forced to spawn right next to the player if the door is built when they return.
Building
oak dungeon doors
is a cheaper and less click-intensive alternative to mahogany or teak furniture. Building an oak door requires 10 oak planks and grants 600 Construction experience. Players can gain up to around 550,000 experience per hour at maximum efficiency.
With the
demon butler
, the player should hold down 1 constantly and use the 'build and remove' trick as seen above. Starting from a full inventory of planks, repeat the following steps:
Click the demon butler to make him fetch 25
oak planks
.
Build and remove 2 doors, leaving the second one built. You should have 5-8 spare oak planks in your inventory at this point.
When the demon butler comes back, remove and build a door, then click the demon butler twice to take the remaining planks and send him away.
Return to step 2.
Alternatively, asking the butler to fetch 20 oak planks will yield slightly lower experience rates while taking away some potential to make mistakes and reducing the amount of required steps per banking cycle. One can still expect to get upwards of 500,000 experience per hour even when making occasional mistakes and without paying full attention.
Since oak dungeon doors are on the 1 option of their build interface, using two RuneLite plugins and holding 1 (Custom Menu Swaps and Menu Entry Swapper) allows for the least-intensive construction training approach that still outputs very good xp rates.
Use the custom swap "Talk-to,Demon Butler" to give him priority over the door on left clicks.
Menu entry swap the door space to
build
, and the built doors to
remove
.
Hold 1, and get familiar with the click timings. This eliminates having to switch keys and having to right click.
