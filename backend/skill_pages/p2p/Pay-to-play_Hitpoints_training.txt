Unlike most skills, Hitpoints is rarely leveled on its own, as most methods of training combat skills ( Attack , Strength , Defence , Ranged , and Magic ) also give Hitpoints experience . However, there are a few methods for training Hitpoints specifically.

## Training Hitpoints through combat[edit|edit source]

Each point of damage dealt directly by the player yields 1.33 Hitpoints XP. Therefore, any combat training method that offers a high XP rate will also train Hitpoints at a high rate.
- Melee training
- Magic training
- Ranged training

## Ice Burst/Barrage[edit|edit source]

After completion of Monkey Madness I and Desert Treasure I , with at least 70 Magic, players can cast Ice Burst / Ice Barrage on the Skeletal Monkeys in the Ape Atoll Dungeon , granting a high amount of Magic and Hitpoints experience per hour. After completion of Monkey Madness II , killing maniacal monkeys with Ice Burst / Ice Barrage is another method that offers even more experience per hour.

## Chinchompas[edit|edit source]

Red or black chinchompas can be used in a similar way to barrage spells, by using them on maniacal monkeys on Ape Atoll for fast Ranged and Hitpoints XP.

## Training Hitpoints alone[edit|edit source]

Skill pures (also known as skillers) or other accounts who wish to train Hitpoints without training other combat skills have a few options. Experience lamps from random events , cleaning finds in the Varrock Museum , completing Achievement Diaries , etc. can be applied to Hitpoints. They can also participate in the Pest Control and Soul Wars minigames and spend reward points on Hitpoints experience, although both require combat levels to enter. Training manuals from the tackling organised crime minigame can also be used for Hitpoints experience, although some combat is required to receive them.
The Witch's House quest can be completed using only rings of recoil , and awards 6325 Hitpoints XP. Observatory Quest also may reward Hitpoints XP--the reward is chosen randomly from a list of several options.
