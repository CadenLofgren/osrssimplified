Farming training focuses heavily on doing tree runs , which is a recurring training method. Much like daily events and recurring money making methods , tree runs give Farming experience passively over time since it is possible to only do 1 or 2 runs per day. Instead of actively training the skill for hours, players only spend a few minutes to do a run, gaining a lot of Farming experience during that short amount of time, and then do other activities while waiting for the patches to grow. While trees take a very long while to grow in real time, players spend very little time actively doing tree runs.
Doing tree runs costs money, and certain saplings and protection payments can be quite expensive. It is recommended to have a decent amount of money to be able to buy a lot of Farming supplies at once, and have a good money making method to sustain the cost of doing tree runs. Herb runs are often highly profitable and they also offer a fair amount of Farming experience, but usually it is better to look into money making alternatives that offer better profit.

## Starting off[edit|edit source]


## Levels 1–38: Questing[edit|edit source]

Early levels can be skipped by completing quests that give Farming experience . Completing the Goblin generals subquest of Recipe for Disaster , Fairytale I - Growing Pains , Forgettable Tale... (requires 17 Farming), The Garden of Death (requires 20 Farming), Garden of Tranquillity (requires 25 Farming), Enlightened Journey (requires 30 Farming), and My Arm's Big Adventure (requires 29 Farming) grants a total of 32,500 experience, which will get the player up to level 38. This skips much of the tedium of low-level Farming and allows the player to do effective farm runs immediately.

## Levels 1–15: Bagged plants[edit|edit source]

The fastest way to train the early levels is to plant bagged plants in the player-owned house . However, it is significantly more expensive than planting seeds.
If the garden supplier does not have enough stock, players can hop worlds to buy more bagged plants.
The quickest way to plant them, assuming that your house is in Rimmington , is to bring three watering cans, a stack of coins, and as many noted bagged plants as you can afford. You can hand your notes to Phials to un-note them (for a small fee) and refill your watering cans in the building just east of the well.
Right-click the plant space and click on Build. To make the process even faster, spam the 1 button while planting and removing the bagged plants. This will select the bagged plant and confirm the removal, allowing you to plant and remove plants very quickly.
Bagged plants are one of the only ways to actively train farming without waiting for anything to grow.

## Levels 1–15: Making supercompost/ultracompost[edit|edit source]

Another option to train the early levels is to make supercompost or ultracompost in a compost bin . Each bucket of supercompost grants 8.5 farming experience, or 10 experience with the addition of volcanic ash to produce ultracompost .
Watermelons and pineapples are the easiest candidates for the produce used, with the latter easily purchased in convenient quantities from Trader Stan's Trading Post .

## Levels 1–15: Farming allotments[edit|edit source]

- Seed Table
- Farming/Patch locations
- Farming runs

## Levels 1–15: Sorceress's garden[edit|edit source]

In the Sorceress's Garden minigame , players can pick sq'irk fruits or herbs from the gardens. No Thieving level is required, but a higher Thieving level increases Thieving experience rates. Picking a sq'irk from the tree yields 30, 40, 50, or 60 Farming experience depending on the room's season. Completing the winter garden to 15 requires 81 laps. Picking from the herb patch yields 50 Farming experience and two random herbs from any garden which requires 49 laps.
This method, once the gardens are set up correct for 1-click methods, is one of the least click-intensive ways to train. Training using only this method from 65 to 99 Thieving yields 503,520 Farming experience.

## Levels 15–99: Tree runs[edit|edit source]

Tree runs are the most effective way to gain Farming experience . To do this, plant the highest-tier tree , fruit tree , and hardwood tree saplings available, along with the special tree saplings ( calquat , celastrus , crystal , and redwood ). After the trees have grown, check the health of a fully grown tree for Farming experience, pay the gardener to chop down the tree, then replant the tree. Repeat until all patches have been checked and replanted.
While tree runs are a passive training method, they offer by far the fastest effective experience. For example, if it took the player 5 minutes to do a tree run and the player gained 100,000 Farming experience from the run, the experience rate would effectively be 1,200,000 experience per hour (12 runs per one actively spent hour). Players would only spend 5 minutes on doing a run, then do something else while the trees grow.
A tree run consisting of 6 magic trees , 6 dragonfruit trees , 1 calquat tree , and 1 celastrus tree takes around 5 minutes and 20 seconds. The run gives a total of 215,761.3 Farming experience when using payments, which would offer around 2,400,000 experience per actively spent hour. When including 4 mahogany trees once every 4 days and a redwood tree once every 5 days, the effective rate is around 2,500,000 experience per actively spent hour.
Even though it is only possible to do 1 or 2 tree runs per day, doing tree runs over time ends up being much faster than doing methods that offer faster experience in real time, such as farming allotments. Tree runs should be the first priority for Farming training, and active training methods should only be done if Farming is the player's last skill to level 99. Getting level 99 Farming should take around 3–4 months at most if the player does tree runs fairly consistently.

## Recommended quests and stats[edit|edit source]

- Tree Gnome Village and The Grand Tree for access to spirit trees for transportation.
- Bone Voyage for access to three hardwood patches on Fossil Island .
- The Ribbiting Tale of a Lily Pad Labour Dispute for access to an additional hardwood patch in Varlamore .
- Plague City for Ardougne Teleport (or Teleport to House to Rimmington ) to access Brimhaven faster via Captain Barnaby (if the player does not have access to redirection scrolls or does not have the player-owned house in Brimhaven).
- Tai Bwo Wannai Trio to be able to use Tai bwo wannai teleport scrolls to the calquat patch. Alternatively, started Fairytale II - Cure a Queen for access to fairy rings .
- Alternatively, started Fairytale II - Cure a Queen for access to fairy rings .
- Started Mourning's End Part I for access to the fruit tree patch in Lletya and teleport crystals .
- Song of the Elves for access to the crystal tree patch.
- 40 to be able to move the player-owned house to Brimhaven
- 40 for casting teleportation spells , although teleport tablets can be used instead.
- Alternatively, started Fairytale II - Cure a Queen for access to fairy rings .

## General information and tips[edit|edit source]

Always pay the farmer to chop down the tree for replanting. This only costs a small amount of money and is much faster than chopping the tree. The celastrus tree has valuable harvest however, so it can be worthwhile to spend extra time to gather the celastrus barks .
It is best to pay the farmer to look after the tree, so it cannot die and players are guaranteed to get the Farming experience from checking the health of the tree. The tree patch in Falador Park will never get diseased after completing the elite Falador Diary . To save money, it can be worthwhile to treat certain patches with ultracompost instead of paying the farmer to look after the tree. This is slower overall however, because the tree will occasionally die and the player would have spent time for no experience gained. Reviving a dead tree with Resurrect Crops helps to reduce the number of trees lost this way.
Buy the saplings from the Grand Exchange . If seeking to save money, buy the tree seeds instead and grow them into saplings. Saplings are made by using a tree seed on a filled plant pot while having a gardening trowel in the inventory, using a watering can on the seedlings to water them and then waiting for them to grow into saplings. Saplings grow while stored in bank, so players do not have to have them in their inventory. Players who have level 68 Magic and have completed Dream Mentor can use Humidify spell to water the seedlings faster.
Regular trees are usually more expensive compared to the other trees. Players who are not in a rush to level up Farming are advised to only farm fruit trees, hardwood trees and special trees for cheaper experience. Depending on the prices, it can also be worthwhile to farm palm trees instead of dragonfruit trees at higher levels, as growing dragonfruit trees costs 11.67 per experience and palm trees would only cost 4.53 per experience, including the protection payments.
Saplings cannot be unnoted at a Tool Leprechaun. If there is not enough room to hold all the saplings needed, resupply at a bank during the run.
Farming boosts can be used to access different tiers of the Farming Guild before obtaining the level required. The level is only checked when attempting to enter the area.

## Example tree runs[edit|edit source]

Start out at the Grand Exchange and buy all of the saplings, payments and teleports needed.
In the first run, the player will have to rake all of the patches. In subsequent runs, this is only necessary if a growth cycle happens in between removing the tree and planting a new one. It is recommended to leave a rake at a Tool Leprechaun in case this happens.

This is an example setup for doing a tree run consisting of 6 trees, 5 fruit trees and 4 hardwood trees at level 35. This run does not include the Lletya fruit tree due to the quests required however the last step is shown as an example, nor the tree and fruit tree patches in the Farming Guild due to the Farming level requirements.
The route assumes the player pays the farmers to chop down the trees and to look after them.

## Other methods[edit|edit source]


## Herb runs[edit|edit source]

Herb runs offer good profit, and decent Farming experience when growing high-level herbs such as torstols . Some players choose to do this to compensate the cost of doing tree runs, or to make money in general. Herbs take 80 minutes to grow. To gain extra Farming experience, players can farm allotments (such as snape grass ) along with herb runs.
Always treat herb patches with ultracompost. This minimises the chance of disease, increases the expected yield, and ensures the minimum amount of 6 herbs per seed when used along with magic secateurs.
By default, three herb patches are available for the player, with the remaining seven requiring the following:
- Morytania : Completed of Priest in Peril
- Harmony Island : Completion of the elite Morytania Diary
- Hosidius : Visit Kourend at least once
- Farming Guild : 65 Farming
- Troll Stronghold : Completed My Arm's Big Adventure
- Weiss : Completed Making Friends with My Arm and additionally built a Fire of Nourishment by the patches
- Civitas illa Fortis : Completed Children of the Sun
- Spade
- Seed dibber (optional if the seed planting portion of Barbarian Training is complete)

At level 47 Farming, players can add allotment runs alongside their herb runs. Allotments usually consist of two sets of farmable patches, with the exception of the one on Harmony Island , which only has one. This level allows players to start growing watermelons . Each harvested watermelon provides 54.5 experience, and a fair amount of watermelons can be harvested with ultracompost and magic secateurs.
Barring the patch on Harmony Island, all allotment patches are either watched by a gardener or have a flower patch. Players are highly encouraged to grow Nasturtiums on the flower patch, as this protects watermelons from disease and ensures they will never die, making yield the only priority.
At level 61 Farming, players should replace the allotments with snape grass ; each harvested spike of grass provides 82 experience. The nasturtiums should also be replaced with white lilies , as this protects all allotments from disease.
By default, three locations are available to the player, with the other six requiring quests and/or additional requirements:
- Falador : No requirements
- Catherby : No requirements
- Ardougne : No requirements
- Morytania : Completed Priest in Peril
- Hosidius : Visit Kourend at least once
- Farming Guild : 45 Farming
- Harmony Island : Started The Great Brain Robbery
- Prifddinas : Completion of Song of the Elves
- Civitas illa Fortis : Completion of Children of the Sun

## Tithe Farm[edit|edit source]

At level 34, experience may be gained at the Tithe Farm minigame. In this way, players can gain significant Farming experience between the time it takes patches to grow, or train exclusively at the minigame to save money on seeds. From level 74 onwards, players can get around 90,000–100,000 experience per hour.
Exclusive rewards obtained through tithe farm can prove useful in training farming, such as the farmer's outfit , the seed box , and the gricoller's can .
