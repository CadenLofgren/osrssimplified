## Fastest experience[edit|edit source]


## Levels 1–30: Poison karambwan[edit|edit source]

From level 1 to 30, 1-tick cook raw karambwan into poison karambwan . Karambwan can be cooked without tick delay by holding down 1 and rapidly using raw karambwan on a fire or range. This method costs money, but the overall loss will be relatively small as reaching level 30 would take less than ten minutes.
Note that cooking poison karambwan does not have any requirements, unlike cooked karambwan .
168 successfully cooked poison karambwan are required to reach level 30. Players are advised to buy at least 500 raw karambwan, as the burn rate is high at lower levels. Assuming all 500 raw karambwan are used to reach level 30, this would result in a loss of −191,500 . If the player is not going to use tick manipulation, it is recommended to cook other fish (see below) as this is cheaper and it would offer similar experience rates.

## Levels 1–30: Cooking fish[edit|edit source]

Alternatively, cook various fish for early experience. This is slower than cooking poison karambwan, but cheaper and less click-intensive.
The fish needed for each level range are shown in the table below. Buy roughly 2.5 times more raw fish than the amount of successfully cooked fish needed, as the burn rate is fairly high at lower levels.
Levels | Fish | XP each | XP total | Successfully cooked fish | Raw fish (approx.) | Price uncooked | Price cooked | Profit/Successfully cooked fish | Profit/XP (approx.)
1-5 |  | Sardine | 40 | 388 | 10 | 25 Raw sardine | 59 | 41 | −18 | -2.66
5-10 |  | Herring | 50 | 766 | 16 | 40 Raw herring | 251 | 60 | −191 | -11.35
10-15 |  | Mackerel | 60 | 1,257 | 21 | 53 Raw mackerel | 43 | 27 | −16 | -1.34
15-20 |  | Trout | 70 | 2,059 | 30 | 75 Raw trout | 101 | 94 | −7 | -2.26
20-25 |  | Pike | 80 | 3,372 | 43 | 108 Raw pike | 111 | 57 | −54 | -2.76
25-30 |  | Salmon | 90 | 5,521 | 62 | 155 Raw salmon | 71 | 71 | 0 | -1.18

## Levels 30–99: Cooked karambwan[edit|edit source]

Completion of the quest Tai Bwo Wannai Trio is required to successfully cook karambwan.
1-tick cooking karambwan provides the fastest Cooking experience. Karambwan can be cooked without tick delay by holding down 1 or space and rapidly using raw karambwan on a fire or range. This requires a lot of click accuracy and can be difficult to do consistently for long periods of time. Without tick manipulation this method offers much lower experience rates and is only recommended as a cheap low-effort alternative.
Using one of the cooking locations right next to a bank offers the fastest experience rates for 1-ticking karambwan. These are located in Rogues' Den , Myths' Guild , and in the inner part of Mor Ul Rek . The Hosidius kitchen is not recommended for 1-ticking due to the increased distance to the bank, which will result in around 10–20% lower experience rates and make mistakes much more likely. Cooking gauntlets do not affect the burn rate for karambwan.
Without tick manipulation the Hosidius kitchen is the best option up to level 96. The lower burn rate outweighs the faster cooking rate of Rogues' Den when not using tick manipulation, since the longer banking time will have less effect on experience rates at a lower cooking speed compared to 1-ticking. Completing the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary at level 79 is recommended for further decreased burn rates. At level 96, use one of the cooking locations right next to a bank for faster experience rates.
The experience rates for 1-ticking assume using the Rogues' Den fire and cooking 5,000 karambwan per hour. At maximum efficiency, it is possible to cook up to 5,470 karambwan per hour. The AFK rates assume cooking 1,385 karambwan per hour at the Hosidius kitchen up to level 96 and 1,435 karambwan per hour in the Rogues' Den afterwards.
level | XP/h (1t) | XP/h (AFK)
30 | 464,000 | 141,000
40 | 534,000 | 160,000
50 | 605,000 | 180,000
60 | 672,000 | 198,000
70 | 742,000 | 218,000
80 | 813,000 | 251,000
90 | 883,000 | 263,000
99 | 950,000 | 273,000
The below table shows the profit from level 30 to 99. The numbers for 1-ticking assume using the Rogues' Den fire, and the numbers for AFK assume using the Hosidius kitchen up to level 96 and the Rogues' Den fire afterwards.
Method | needed | Profit total | GP/XP
1-tick | 75,185 | 10,541,513 | 0.81
AFK | 71,289 | 12,033,681 | 0.92

## Other methods[edit|edit source]


## Levels 10–99: Bake Pie[edit|edit source]

Completion of the quest Lunar Diplomacy is required to cast Bake Pie .
Baking pies using the Bake Pie spell offers relatively fast experience at a low amount of effort. It also offers a decent amount of passive Magic experience, which can be useful for some players. This method can be fairly expensive due to the low supply of uncooked pies, and some options may not be viable due to low trading volumes.
Compared to cooking pies on a range, Bake Pie is cast at a rate of once per 3 ticks instead of the usual 4 ticks, yielding 33.33% faster cooking speeds. An inventory of 27 pies takes 81 ticks (48.6 seconds) to cook. Additionally, the pies never burn.
The experience rates in the table below assume players bake 1,885 pies per hour, which would also give 113,100 passive Magic experience per hour. The costs assume the player is wearing a steam battlestaff or other items that give unlimited water and fire runes, such as a Tome of Fire .
level | Item | XP each | XP/h | Supply cost each | Profit each | Profit/XP
10 |  | Redberry pie | 78 | 147,000 | 550 | −452 | -5.79
20 |  | Meat pie | 110 | 207,000 | 609 | −561 | -5.10
29 |  | Mud pie | 128 | 241,000 | 1,617 | −577 | -4.51
30 |  | Apple pie | 130 | 245,000 | 534 | −456 | -3.51
34 |  | Garden pie | 138 | 260,000 | 1,539 | −1,469 | -10.64
47 |  | Fish pie | 164 | 309,000 | 1,553 | −1,212 | -7.39
52 |  | Botanical pie | 180 | 339,000 | 2,548 | −1,538 | -8.54
60 |  | Mushroom pie | 200 | 377,000 | 8,970 | −226 | -1.13
70 |  | Admiral pie | 210 | 396,000 | 1,619 | −1,469 | -7.00
73 |  | Dragonfruit pie | 220 | 415,000 | 2,646 | −2,101 | -9.55
85 |  | Wild pie | 240 | 452,000 | 4,633 | −3,926 | -16.36
95 |  | Summer pie | 260 | 490,000 | 1,754 | −804 | -3.09

## Levels 35/68–99: Jug of wine[edit|edit source]

Making jugs of wine offers relatively fast experience. This method costs money, but it is usually fairly cheap depending on the Grand Exchange prices. It requires more attention than cooking fish or casting Bake Pie, however.
Jugs of wine are made by combining grapes with jugs of water to make unfermented wines , and after 12 seconds they will ferment into jugs of wine. Wines ferment in the bank, so players do not have to wait for the wines to ferment in the inventory. The 12-second timer resets each time the player makes a new jug of unfermented wine, whether banked or in the inventory, which means a large stack of wine in the bank can ferment all at once. Successfully making each jug of wine grants 200 experience.
Grapes are added to jugs of water at a rate of once per 2 ticks, which is double the rate most items are cooked on a range or fire. This, combined with the high 200 experience per jug of wine, is why wine has such fast experience rates. However, with only 14 produced per inventory, making jugs of wine requires more attention than most other cooking items, as one inventory of ingredients can be combined every 16.8 seconds, compared to the 67.2 seconds it takes to cook an entire inventory.
Players can gain up to 490,000 experience per hour from level 68 onwards. Below level 68, there is a chance for a jug of bad wine to be produced for 0 experience. Players using this method below level 68 should only make enough wines to get to their next cooking level to be as efficient as possible due to the chances of successfully creating wines increasing with every level gained.
Jugs of wine required: 62,147
- Experience required: 12,429,399
- 38 per jug of water
- 71 per grapes
- 3 value per Jug of wine
- −106 cost per wine
- -0.53 cost per XP
- −6,587,582 cost from level 68-99
- −259,700 cost per hour (at 490,000 experience rate)
- Experience per hour: from 470,000 to 490,000
- Time spent: 25 hours, 30 minutes

## Levels 30–99: Cooking fish[edit|edit source]

Cooking various fish is a cheap or profitable low-effort alternative to the faster methods. Cooking an inventory of fish takes around 1 minute and 14 seconds in the Hosidius Kitchen, including banking.
The cooking gauntlets from the Family Crest quest reduce the burn rate for lobsters , swordfish , monkfish , sharks , and anglerfish when worn. Having the gauntlets is required for optimal rates when cooking these fish. Expect much lower rates without the gauntlets.
Completing the easy Kourend & Kebos Diary grants access to the cooking ranges in the Hosidius Kitchen . They provide a 5% increased chance of successfully cooking food over standard cooking ranges. This is increased to 10% after completing the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary , which requires level 84 Cooking (boostable). Cooking fish in the Hosidius Kitchen offers comparable or slightly higher experience rates than at the ranges in Myths' Guild or Mor Ul Rek because of the increased cooked rate, despite the ranges being slightly further away from a bank. The Hosidius ranges remain comparable or better until level 93, after which it becomes faster to cook anglerfish on a normal range.
The fish and experience needed for each level range are shown in the table below. The experience rates assume 1,365 fish cooked per hour in the Hosidius Kitchen, or 1,435 fish cooked per hour in Myths' Guild or Mor Ul Rek. The rates assume wearing the cooking gauntlets (where applicable) and using the Hosidius kitchen unless noted otherwise. Cooking in the Hosidius kitchens assumes completion of the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary from level 79 Cooking onwards (with a +5 boost to level 84). Experience and profit rates take the burn rates into account. The actual amounts of raw fish needed can vary depending on luck, so slightly more or less fish may be needed. Swordfish and monkfish offer very similar rates for levels 68–80, so choose whichever is more profitable.
Levels | Fish | XP each | Approx. XP/h (w/o burns) | XP total | Raw fish needed | Successfully cooked fish needed | Price raw | Price cooked | Profit total | Profit/XP
30–40 |  | Tuna | 100 | 85,000–100,000 (143,500) | 23,861 | 340 | 239 | 83 | 115 | −735 | -0.03

## Choosing Cooking locations[edit|edit source]

Cooking most foods takes four game ticks , and 28 can be cooked per inventory. Therefore, a full inventory takes 112 ticks or 67.2 seconds, making Cooking one of the least attentive skills in the game.
Assuming no banking and no food burned, a player could theoretically cook up to 1,500 raw foods per hour; however, factoring in bank-time, players can expect to cook between 1,300 and 1,400. The following table compares the different cooking locations by their bank proximity and corresponding items cooked per hour. The table assumes the bank distance is ran, no food is burnt, and that banking takes 3 seconds (5 ticks).
Location | Spaces from bank* | Time to cook full inventory and bank | Food cooked per hour (assuming 0 burned) | Benefits | Location
Theoretical maximum | 0 | 67.2 seconds (112 ticks) | 1500 | N/A | N/A
Myths' Guild | 0 | 70.2 seconds (117 ticks) | 1435 | Has a stove and a bank diagonally next to the stove, making it better than the Rogues' Den due to it being a stove and not a fire. Requires completion of Dragon Slayer II . | Right next to the bank. The mythical cape will teleport you there directly.
Rogues' Den | 0 | 70.2 seconds (117 ticks) | 1435 | The banker ( Emerald Benedict ) is just a step away from the fire and never moves, allowing players to cut down on time spent walking. The fire is everlasting, so there is no need to worry about relighting it, saving inventory space. On the downside, Rogues' Den only has a fire as the means to cook, so it is only usable for cooking fish or meat, and it does not offer the benefit of reduced burning on a range. | Start of the Rogues' Den, just below the Burthorpe pub. A games necklace will bring you very close to the pub.
Mor Ul Rek | 0 | 70.2 seconds (117 ticks) | 1435 | A sulphur vent is located right next to a bank chest. The TzHaar will only allow those who show a fire cape to the TzHaar-Ket guarding the entrance to enter this area. The sulphur vent functions as a fire, so it is only usable for cooking fish or meat, and it does not offer the benefit of reduced burning on a range. | In the inner area of the city.
Cooks' Guild | 2 | 71.4 seconds (119 ticks) | 1411 | Few players, so peaceful cooking environment. Requires a chef's hat and 32 Cooking to enter. Completion of the Hard Varrock Diary or 99 Cooking is required to use the bank. | Just south of the Grand Exchange. Can be teleported to directly with a skills necklace .
Hosidius clay oven | 6 | 73.8 seconds (123 ticks) | 1365 | Decreases the chances of burning your food by 5%, and up to 10% with completion of the elite Kourend & Kebos Diary . Requires completion of the easy Kourend & Kebos diary to use. | South-east of the Mess Hall .
Ruins of Unkah | 6 | 73.8 seconds (123 ticks) | 1365 | An everlasting fire that acts as a range. Fish can be picked up from other players dropping their Tempoross reward pool rewards several spaces away. | West side of the Ruins of Unkah by the Sea Spirit Dock .
Port Khazard | 8 | 75 seconds (125 ticks) | 1344 | Quiet spot that is routinely empty with nice scenery. The fire is everlasting, and easy to reach via Charter ship . Using an Ectophial to teleport to Port Phasmatys and using the charter from there makes for a fairly quick commute. | North of Yanille , along the ocean.
Wintertodt Camp | 8 | 75 seconds (125 ticks) | 1344 | Because it counts as a campfire, there is a higher chance of burning than a range. It is, however, very easy to access and everlasting. | South-west of the Wintertodt bank chest.
Museum Camp | 12 | 77.4 seconds (129 ticks) | 1302 | While slightly further away than the previous two, this source counts as a range, and puts you close to where you'd do birdhouse runs while training. | Just north-east of the Fossil Island bank.
Catherby | 17 | 80.4 seconds (134 ticks) | 1253 | Fish can be picked up from those training fishing nearby, resulting in slower experience but at no cost. | Just east of bank. Close to Camelot teleport .
Lumbridge Castle | 22 | 83.4 seconds (139 ticks) | 1208 | Reduces the level at which certain foods are burned. Requires completion of Cook's Assistant Quest. This location is not recommended at higher levels when food is no longer burned, but may save time at earlier levels, as trips take longer but more food is successfully cooked. It's slightly faster to stand east of the ladder before going up so you don't run around the ladder. See Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle) for which foods. | Ground floor of the Lumbridge Castle . Close to the Lumbridge Teleport spell location.
*Running takes 0.5 ticks per square. A bank 4 tiles away will require you to traverse 8 tiles (there and back), so crossing 8 tiles at 2 tiles per tick will take 4 ticks.

## Calculating exact times[edit|edit source]

To find the exact number of ticks to cook one inventory at any given location, players can first use the formula 1 1 7 + ( t i l e s ) , where 1 1 7 refers to the minimum ticks taken to cook and bank, and ( t i l e s ) refers to the number of tiles the cooking source is from the bank. If run is enabled, divide (tiles) by 2 and round up. Players can translate this into seconds by multiplying it by 0 . 6 , the number of seconds per tick.
Players can then find out how many items they can cook in an hour by taking the number of ticks and putting it into the formula ( 3 6 0 0 / ( x ) ) ⋅ 2 8 . Here, 3 6 0 0 refers to the number of seconds in an hour, x refers to the number of seconds it takes to do one inventory, and 2 8 refers to the number of inventory spaces the player has. Players should round down to the nearest whole number.
