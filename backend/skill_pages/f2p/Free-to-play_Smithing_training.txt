This guide outlines the best methods for training the Smithing skill in free-to-play . There are a few ways to profit with Smithing in free-to-play, such as smelting bars or making rune equipment , however it is more beneficial to simply perform the fastest experience methods and use the saved time to make money from alternative methods.

When making equipment with bars , experience gained is based off the number of bars used, therefore using larger amounts of bars at once yields the highest experience rates. This means smithing platebodies when available is always the fastest experience per tier of bar. The best place to smith bars is the anvil south of Varrock west bank , as it is the closest anvil to a bank in free-to-play. Energy potions ( 192 ) can optionally be brought in the two empty inventory spaces when making platebodies to continuously sprint with level 1 Agility , at an added cost of roughly 1.48 per bar (1 energy potion dose per 32.5 bars). Depending on starting gp and profit from making certain platebodies, one can gain much more gold per hour as well as experience per hour using energy potions instead of letting run energy recharge naturally by walking.
An option available to players with 55 Magic is to cast High Level Alchemy on their created platebodies to either reduce costs, increase profits, or gain Magic experience. If choosing to alch their platebodies, then it is possible to alch 1-2 platebodies efficiently as a zero time Magic training method on the run from the anvil back to the bank. For this, one should equip a staff of fire and bring nature runes in place of one of their energy potions while smithing. Otherwise, the platebodies can be alched later, on their own or during other activities such as combat .

Smithing adamant platebodies from levels 87/88 to 98/99 may take upwards of 35-45 hours depending on efficiency and use of energy potions .
Note: The next section for rune platebodies is helpful and slightly faster experience per hour. However, most players will opt to continue smithing adamant platebodies all the way to level 99 even though rune platebodies are more experience per item, as adamant platebodies may be cheaper experience per gold spent for comparable XP rates.

## Level 20-88: Smelting and Crafting[edit|edit source]

Crafting gold jewellry (and silver jewellry ) is a potentially profitable way to train Crafting . If you're already making jewellry, you can use gold ore (or silver ore ) to first make a gold bar (or silver bar ). While this is a significantly slower overall method of training smithing, the marginal time cost of smelting is simply the smelting itself (because you already have to make trips between the bank and furnace anyway). Your effective marginal smelting rate is 1200 bars an hour (one bar every 5 ticks ); or potentially even more, as the increased time per bank trip allows run energy to recover sustainably.

Gold ore | 40 | Gold bar | 22.5 | 1200 | 27,000 | −31,200 | -1.16

## Level 70-99: Superheat Item[edit|edit source]

Players with level 43 can cast superheat item , which can smelt a bar from anywhere at its normal ore cost, plus 1 nature rune and 4 fire runes (no fire runes are necessary with a staff of fire equipped). This saves time travelling between the furnace and bank. Also, it only has a 3 tick cast time (1.8 seconds) rather than the standard 5 ticks (3 seconds) it takes to smelt a bar in a furnace. As such, it can process more bars per hour, earning Magic experience in addition to the normal Smithing xp. As a bonus, it successfully smelts iron bars 100% of the time, without needing a ring of forging .
One disadvantage of superheat item is that it does not auto-cast if you have the supplies to make multiple bars; it must be cast on each ore in the inventory, making this method more click intensive.
While this method is still considerably slower at gaining experience than the fastest experience mentioned above, it can be more cost effective.
Bar | Levels Required | Experience Per Bar | Materials required | Input cost | GE Price | Profit Per Bar | Bars Per Bank | Banks Per Hour | Bars Per Hour | Experience Per Hour | Profit Per Hour | Coins Profit Per Exp
 | Bronze bar | 1 43 | 6.2 53 | ×1 ×1 ×1 | 163 | 94 | −69 | 13 | 131 | 1,703 | 10,559 90,259 | −117,507 | -11.13

This table assumes a staff of fire is equipped and each cycle takes ~4 seconds for banking.

## Level 98-99: Smithing Rune Equipment[edit|edit source]

Using a dwarven stout , players can boost from 98 to 99 Smithing and smith rune platelegs , rune plateskirts , and rune 2h swords as a potentially profitable alternative to adamant/rune platebodies. One dwarven stout must be drank every minute to maintain 99 Smithing from 98; this adds a cost of approximately one dwarven stout per 45 runite bars , or roughly 3.02 per bar. Currently, the most profitable 3 bar rune item to smith when selling on the Grand Exchange is Rune 2h sword . If casting High Level Alchemy after smithing, it does not matter whether rune platelegs , rune plateskirts , or rune 2h swords are made, as they have the same High Level Alchemy value.
Experience rates of approximately 215,000 Smithing experience per hour can be obtained from equipment made with 3 runite bars .
- Starting experience: 11,805,787.5
- Experience required: 1,228,643.5
- Runite bars required: 16,383
- Most profitable: Rune 2h sword
- Input cost (bars and stouts): 202,051,903.07
- Output: 206,840,836
- Profit: 4,788,932.93 ( 876.93 each)
- High alchemy ( 55 ) profit: 7,088,013.93 ( 1,297.93 each)

## AFK Methods[edit|edit source]


## Level 1-99: Smelting Bars[edit|edit source]

As stated at the start of this guide, if you are just looking to make money or train smithing as fast as possible, it is usually better to train smithing using the faster methods above and use the time saved on faster money makers. However, smelting bars can be a good method for players looking for an AFK method that also generates a profit. Be sure to check the GE before making any bars to make sure you will be making a profit instead of a loss. To use this method, it is recommended that you bank a large number of ores ahead of time: either by purchasing them from the GE, or mining them yourself if you don't have any gold or want the mining experience. Then head to the Edgeville Furnace as it is the closest furnace to a bank in free-to-play.
Consult the following table to see profits from smelting bars:
Bar | Level | Experience | Ore required | Input cost | GE Price | Profit
 | Bronze bar | 1 | 6.2 | ×1 ×1 | 60 | 94 | 34
 | Iron bar | 15 | 12.5 | ×1 | 137 144.24 [ 1 ] | 192 | -41.00 47.76 [ 1 ]
 | Silver bar | 20 | 13.67 | ×1 | 62 | 89 | 27
 | Steel bar | 30 | 17.5 | ×1 ×2 | 515 | 546 | 31
 | Gold bar | 40 | 22.5 | ×1 | 131 | 105 | −26
 | Mithril bar | 50 | 30 | ×1 ×4 | 889 | 850 | −39
 | Adamantite bar | 70 | 37.5 | ×1 ×6 | 1,883 | 1,837 | −46
 | Runite bar | 85 | 50 | ×1 ×8 | 11,683 | 12,330 | 647
- ^ 1.0 1.1 1.2 This is based on using the Ring of forging for smelting, guaranteeing successful smelting of iron.

## Level 14+: Barronite Deposits[edit|edit source]

With 14 Mining and 14 Smithing , barronite deposits can be mined from barronite rocks in the Camdozaal Mines after completing the quest Below Ice Mountain . Using them on the special barronite crusher anvil near Ramarno with a hammer yields various rewards, including barronite shards and 30 Smithing experience. This method generates very slow smithing experience since the deposits are untradeable and must be mined before crushing. If you are also trying to AFK train Mining in Camdozaal, crushing deposits can be a good way to generate some additional Smithing experience, otherwise it is better to use any of the other methods in this guide. Since Smithing experience is directly tied to how quickly barronite deposits can be mined, a higher Mining level will lead to higher Smithing experience rates.
If using this method, the best technique is to keep a hammer and the highest tier pickaxe you can in your inventory and mine the barronite rocks until your inventory is full. If you have a high enough Attack level, wielding your pickaxe will give you an extra inventory slot for a deposit, however it is better to carry a higher tier pickaxe in your inventory than wielding a lower tier one. Once your inventory is full of deposits, head to the barronite crusher and crush all of the deposits for Smithing experience. You can drop any items you get from the deposits, or bank them at the bank chest east of Ramarno; however, since barronite shards stack, it is easiest just to leave them in your inventory for the entire session and use them to purchase buffs from Ramarno. The mining and boost buffs will increase your experience rates, and the luck buff will increase the odds of finding rare ancient artefacts when crushing deposits.
