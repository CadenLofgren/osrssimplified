Hitpoints is almost always trained through combat with any of the combat styles , melee, ranged, or magic. The ratio of combat experience to hitpoint experience is 3:1 for melee and ranged. For magic it is dependent on the spell being used, the magic defence of the target, and the attack style used. Skill pures , also known as skillers, can train Hitpoints with experience lamps to avoid combat, the only way to do so in free-to-play .
