This article provides information about effective ways to train Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints through melee combat in free-to-play.

This guide is organised into sections based on skill levels. For example, if the section header is Levels 20 to 30, you should begin training at the area with an Attack and Strength level of at least 20. Defence is also preferred to be at that level, but is not always required. The solution to lower Defence is to bring more food, or use food that heals more.

Equipment choice
Players should always use the best scimitar they can equip as scimitars offer the highest damage per second of any other type of free-to-play melee weapon due to their high speed and high strength bonus. Use the amulet of strength if it gives a higher max hit for your Strength level, otherwise use the amulet of power for more accuracy, defence, and especially if it provides the same maximum damage as the amulet of strength at certain Strength levels with certain attack styles. Use full melee armour sets against monsters that use melee, and ranged armour against monsters that use magic. A chainbody is more useful than a platebody against monsters that use crush.

As for boots, you may start off with fancy boots or fighting boots (both have same stats as members' bronze boots) that are awarded in the Stronghold of Security, or leather boots if you don't want to reclaim the stronghold boots when you die. The best-in-slot boots for melee combat is decorative boots (gold) for its melee defence and its +1 Strength bonus (same stats as members' adamant boots). However, the time it takes to obtain gold decorative boots (400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time spent to train melee skills to 99 but if you quickly want more defence bonus over fancy or fighting boots to tank more hits, decorative boots (red) (same stats as members' steel boots) is a decent defence upgrade with +4 more defence bonus than fancy/fighting boots that can easily be obtained within a few Castle Wars matches (4 castle wars tickets) and with a bit more time put into Castle Wars, decorative boots (white) (same stats as members' mithril boots, 40 castle wars tickets) is a good defence upgrade with +3 more defence bonuses than red boots if you don't wish to spend a lot of time going for decorative boots (gold) for the gold boots' +1 Strength Bonus.

As for capes, all coloured capes, team capes, and the cabbage cape share the same defence bonus and are best-in-slot for free-to-play players. For gloves, gilded d'hide vambraces are best-in-slot but require 40 Ranged to equip and may be prohibitively expensive for some players. A cheaper alternative is green d'hide vambraces, otherwise the next best choice is leather vambraces or leather/coloured gloves depending on enemy attack style until 40 Ranged is achieved.

Maximum hit

Rune scimitars offer the best damage per second (DPS) in free-to-play and is recommended to use for melee training from Level 40 Attack and all melee skill onwards so it is recommended to achieve Level 40 Attack as soon as possible. Training Attack slightly increases the attack accuracy of your hits. However, training Strength is important for increasing maximum damage which also increases damage per second.

To further increase damage per second, there are three free-to-play neck slot items that can provide attack and/or strength bonuses including amulet of accuracy, amulet of power, and amulet of strength. If the player cannot afford an amulet of power or if an ironman cannot acquire an amulet of strength ( to craft a ruby amulet and  for Lvl-3 Enchant) or an amulet of power ( to craft a diamond amulet and  for Lvl-4 Enchant), the amulet of accuracy from Imp Catcher is a weaker alternative to the amulet of power (without a strength bonus) until the player can acquire one of the other two amulets.

The skill to train first depends on the player's preference and a preferential example could be to keep melee skills (and Defence) within five or ten levels of each other while prioritising one combat skill over the others. If the player wants to deal the most damage first, the player would prioritise training Strength until they achieve a new maximum hit for a different attack style to train the next combat skill with the amulet of power.

Strength levels 1 to 99
The following tables below will determine the maximum of damage certain weapons can inflict on enemies at certain attack styles with the following amulets at certain Strength levels so that you can determine which enchanted amulet you should use at certain Strength levels. The aggressive attack style adds an invisible +3 Strength level boost, the amulet of power adds a +6 Melee Strength bonus, and the amulet of strength adds a +10 Melee Strength bonus. Amulet of accuracy is not included in the table since it does not provide a strength bonus, and even though gold decorative boots from Castle Wars provide a Melee Strength bonus of +1 with higher defence bonuses than fighting boots/fancy boots, the amount of time it takes to acquire the boots (over 40 hours if winning Castle Wars every time to 400 castle wars tickets) is not worth the time to train Attack, Strength, and Defence to 99 and so the tables will not account for gold decorative boots' bonus.

Strength levels higher than 99 are strength boosts from the use of beer or strength potion. At level 99 Strength, a strength potion will temporarily boost strength up to 111.

Barronite mace
Free-to-play ironmen can only acquire a rune scimitar through smithing at level 90 Smithing (or level 89 Smithing with a dwarven stout). Until then, the second best option for free-to-play ironmen to effectively train melee combat is barronite mace, which can be obtained by exchanging a barronite guard, barronite handle, barronite head, and 1,500 barronite shards to Ramarno in the Ruins of Camdozaal after the completion of Below Ice Mountain.

Rune sword
The third best option would be the rune sword, or alternatively the rune mace at certain Strength levels depending on which amulet you use, both of which can be bought from the Champions' Guild. While rune longswords are stronger and more accurate than rune swords and rune maces, it is slower, resulting in a lower damage per second. Rune swords provide the third best melee damage per second in free-to-play and are good for ironmen to train with until a barronite mace or rune scimitar is obtained.

The maximum hit table below is for the rune sword.

Alternative accounts in Clan Wars
If you have a 1 Defence combat pure and high Hitpoints (80+ HP for example), stock them up with jugs of wine and attack them in the Free-For-All Clan Wars portal. This is the fastest combat training method in free-to-play when done efficiently. This training method is not recommended for players who have not yet made a one-Defence combat pure account and it wouldn't be worth the time training one up just for this training method alone. But it is recommended for alternate accounts created after a high HP one-Defence combat pure account.

Alternatively, wizard's mind bombs can reduce a character's Defence towards 0 Defence but Defence will regenerate by a point every 60 seconds.

Alternative accounts in Castle Wars
Thanks to the castle wars bracelet and castlewars brew, the Castle Wars minigame provides considerable combat bonuses in comparison to the Clan Wars minigame. By attacking a 1 Defence combat pure holding a captured flag, you can achieve the highest maximum melee hits in free-to-play worlds. The alternative account can be healed with bandages without the need to bring any supplies. To make the healing more effective, wear a castle wars bracelet. Note that the healing scales with the Hitpoints level, so to maximise the effect the account needs at least 90 level.
