Training
The fastest Firemaking experience is gained by burning the highest-tier log available. The best place to do this tick-perfectly is at the eastern part of the Grand Exchange, as the bank is only one tile away from an area a log can be burned and the area has a lot of empty space. When correctly timed, the player can move to another square in between lighting the logs, which allows the player to burn the logs in any formation. The player should have noted logs in the inventory, and use them on a banker while standing 2 steps away when banking for more logs. A log is lit every 4 game ticks or 2.4 seconds, meaning a theoretical perfect rate of 1,500 logs per hour; the table below assumes 1,485 logs lit per hour.

An easier but a slower method is to simply burn logs in a row from east to west. The best place to do this is at Varrock: use Varrock Teleport, light the logs from the fountain and bank at the Varrock west bank.

Additionally, with the introduction of Forestry, players can utilize the Forester's Campfire as a method of AFK Firemaking training at the same Firemaking experience per log although much slower this way.

Level 1–99
This section will show the time and number of logs needed to reach level 99 Firemaking if switching to each newly unlocked log type you can burn as soon as possible. It would take a player approximately 44 hours to reach level 99 Firemaking from level 1 if switching to each newly unlocked log type that they can burn as soon as possible.

Level 1–15: Normal logs
 The quickest way to get from level 1 to level 15 is by burning normal logs, which grant 40 experience per log. Normal logs from trees, evergreen, dead and dying trees can be cut nearly everywhere in Gielinor ranging from Lumbridge to the Wilderness. Purchasing the logs for 1 to 15 Firemaking is not necessary as getting level 15 is only several minute's work; only 61 logs have to be burnt to raise Firemaking from level 1 to 15. One must cut normal logs to train the first levels of Woodcutting anyway, so one may as well burn these logs to obtain 15 Firemaking.

Logs needed: 61

Level 15–30: Oak logs
 The quickest way to get from level 15 to level 30 is by burning oak logs, which grant 60 experience per log. Oak trees can be cut almost everywhere. Level 15 Woodcutting to cut the oak logs may be useful; oak logs can also be bought from other players.
Experience needed: 10,952
Oak logs needed: 183
Time: 7 minutes 20 seconds (440 seconds)

Level 30–45: Willow logs
 The quickest way to get from level 30 to level 45 is by burning willow logs, which grant 90 experience per log. Willow logs can be bought from other players or they can be cut with a Woodcutting level of at least 30. Willow trees can be cut near the River Lum in Lumbridge, near Edgeville, near the sea south of Draynor Village bank, south of the cabbage patch north-west of Draynor Village, or in Rimmington.
Experience needed: 48,149
Willow logs needed: 535
Time: 21 minutes 24 seconds (1,284 seconds)

Level 45–60: Maple logs
 The quickest way to get from level 45 to level 60 is by burning maple logs, which grant 135 experience per log. Free to play players may cut them or purchase them via the Grand Exchange. Many players choose to burn maple logs from level 45 until level 99.
Experience needed: 212,230
Maple logs needed: 1,572
Time: 1 hour 2 minutes 53 seconds (3,773 seconds)
Money spent: 

Level 60–99: Yew logs
 The fastest way to get from level 60 to level 99 is by burning yew logs, which grant 202.5 experience per log. These can be cut yourself, but it is much more efficient overall to buy them from other players. Though faster, this method is considerably more expensive than burning willow or maple logs.
Experience needed: 12,760,689
Yew logs needed: 63,016

Other methods
Level 30–99: Willow logs
 Using exclusively willow logs are a cheap, albeit slow, route to achieving level 99 in Firemaking. Burning willow logs grants 90 experience per log.
Experience needed: 13,021,068
Willow logs needed: 144,679
Time: 96 hours 27 minutes 11 seconds (347,230 seconds)

Level 45–99: Maple logs
 The cheapest way to get from level 45 to level 99 is by burning maple logs, which grants 135 experience per log. Currently, maple logs ( coins) are cheaper than willow logs ( coins), so this method is recommended for free-to-players on a budget. As maple logs give 45 more experience per log than willows and cost  less coins, this method is strictly better than burning willow logs once players reach level 45, and is the most cost-efficient method overall for those not utilising yew logs.
