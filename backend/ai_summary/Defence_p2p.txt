### Level 1–20
Train on **chickens** and **cows** around **Lumbridge** for very safe early Defence XP and easy loot.  
Complete early melee quests for big early gains: **Witch's House** (Hitpoints) and **Waterfall Quest** (huge Attack/Strength boost that speeds future combat training).  
Important items: **food** and a **teleportation tablet** or teleports for quick escape.  
Key unlocks: quest XP can skip large portions of low-level grinding and unlock better weapons/gear earlier.

### Level 20–40
Main training methods: **rock crabs** (AFK, high HP, low damage), **ogres** and **chaos druids** (if you want additional drops/loot), plus continuing questing for XP.  
Important locations: **Rock Crabs** (various beaches), **ogre training spots** and chaos druid camps.  
Notable items: complete **Holy Grail** (large Defence XP reward) if requirements met; keep better defensive armour as you upgrade.  
Key transitions: reach the Attack/Strength levels from quests (e.g. Waterfall) so you can equip stronger weapons and move to faster XP methods.

### Level 40–60
Main training methods: **moss giants** and other mid‑level slayer/combat monsters; begin using **Nightmare Zone** from ~50 for efficient, semi‑AFK defence/combat XP.  
Important locations: **Moss giant** camps (e.g. Varrock/other sites), **Nightmare Zone** minigame.  
Notable items: **Culinaromancer's gloves** (Recipe for Disaster) for offensive boost when training; consider **obsidian armour + Berserker necklace** setups for faster kills.  
Key unlocks/transitions: access to **Nightmare Zone** strategies for steady XP and the start of profitable Slayer methods.

### Level 60–80
Main training methods: **Nightmare Zone** (AFK/high XP with proper setup), **Slayer** tasks (start efficient profitable training), **Pest Control** for consistent defensive XP and access to Void rewards.  
Important locations: **Nightmare Zone**, **Slayer dungeons/assignments**, **Pest Control / Void Knight Outpost**.  
Notable items: **Void knight equipment** (Pest Control), **Toktz-xil-ak**, **obsidian armour + Berserker necklace**, and using **protection prayers** when fighting dangerous monsters.  
Key transitions: unlock higher‑tier Slayer machines and minigame methods; Pest Control/Void becomes a long‑term option for sustained Defence training.

### Level 80–99
Main training methods: continue **Nightmare Zone** for AFK highest‑hour XP setups; focus on high‑level **Slayer** tasks (e.g. **gargoyles**, **Scurrius**, **Sulphur Naga**, **rune dragons** at ~90+) for efficient combined Defence/Slayer XP; use **Pest Control** for reliable, low‑risk Defence gains.  
Important locations: **Nightmare Zone**, high‑level Slayer locations and dungeons, **Pest Control**.  
Notable items: high‑end melee sets (**Dharok/Guthan** styles where relevant), **Void knight equipment**, **Culinaromancer's gloves**, **Toktz-xil-ak** and defensive best‑in‑slot gear as available. Consider **Ancient Magicks** (defensive spells) or using **chinchompas on long fuse** at maniacal monkeys as alternative methods to train Defence more quickly than pure melee in some cases.  
Key unlocks/transitions: endgame choices are AFK NMZ or high‑level Slayer for fastest route to 99 Defence; equip best defensive/offensive gear available to maximise kill speed and XP.
