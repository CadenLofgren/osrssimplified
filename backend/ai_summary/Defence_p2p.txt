Important training methods (what to do), relevant locations/activities, and level requirements

Fastest / recommended progression
- Questing (Levels 1–30): Waterfall Quest — no requirements; instantly grants Attack and Strength up to ~30. Completing the recommended early quests (Waterfall, Witch's House, Fight Arena, Tree Gnome Village, etc.) gets you roughly to Attack 45 / Strength 37 / Defence 31 without melee grinding.
- Levels 30–50: Crabs (low-aggro crabs). (Listed as the go-to 30–50 method.)
- Levels 50–70: Nightmare Zone (Normal Rumble). (Best-in-slot gear/boosts recommended; maintain Attack/Defence to use optimal weapons.)
- Levels 70–99: Nightmare Zone (higher modes). (Primary AFK/high‑xp method into endgame.)

Other effective melee methods (by level range)
- Levels 1–10: Chickens (beginner AFK training).
- Levels 10–60: Rock Crabs.
- Levels 30–60: Chaos druids.
- Levels 30–81: Ogres.
- Levels 40–60: Moss giants.
- Levels 60–70: Wilderness Slayer (use Slayer tasks in the Wilderness).
- Levels 70–99: Slayer (general); Gargoyles are highlighted as a main high‑level Slayer train.
- Levels 60/70–99: Scurrius (listed as an option for mid→high levels).
- Levels 60/70–99: Sulphur Naguas (listed as a high‑level training alternative).
- Levels 60/70–99: Pest Control (minigame — used for combat training and points/rewards).
- Levels 90–99: Rune dragons (endgame combat training).

Quests recommended for early melee (major ones and requirements)
- Waterfall Quest — no requirements; immediate Attack & Strength XP to reach ~30.
- Witch's House — no requirements; large Hitpoints XP (recommended for safety).
- Fight Arena — no requirements.
- Tree Gnome Village — no requirements.
- Holy Grail — requires 20 Attack and Merlin's Crystal; grants large Defence XP.
- The Grand Tree — requires Agility 25.
- Vampyre Slayer — no requirements.
- Scorpion Catcher — requires Prayer 31 and Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl completion.
- Tai Bwo Wannai Trio — requires Agility 15, Cooking 30, Fishing 5 and Jungle Potion completion.
- Horror from the Deep — requires Agility 35 and Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl completion.
- (Additional higher‑req quests: Dragon Slayer I, Heroes' Quest, Fremennik series, Recipe for Disaster — check their specific requirements before attempting.)

Other notes relevant to Defence training
- Defence can be trained non‑melee: Ancient Magicks (defensive spells) or using chinchompas (long fuse) on Maniacal monkeys can yield more Defence XP/hr than melee.
- Slayer is recommended to train combat stats while profiting; many high‑xp melee methods are Slayer‑based.
- Complete early melee XP quests before heavy training to unlock better equipment and significantly speed further training.
