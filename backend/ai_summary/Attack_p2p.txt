### Level 1–30
- Main training methods: **Questing** (fast Attack/Strength XP) and low-level monsters such as **chickens**/**cows** for early kills.  
- Important locations: **Waterfall Quest** (instant to ~30 Attack & Strength), **Lumbridge** (chickens/cows), quest areas for **Witch's House**, **Fight Arena**, **Tree Gnome Village**.  
- Notable items: quest rewards that boost melee access (e.g. **Hitpoints** from **Witch's House**).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: complete **Waterfall Quest** (no requirements) to reach ~30 Attack/Strength immediately; complete recommended melee XP quests to accelerate access to better equipment.

### Level 30–50
- Main training methods: **AFK crabs** (sustained, low-risk XP) and continued **questing** if unfinished. **Slayer** tasks can be introduced for combined profit and combat XP.  
- Important locations: **Rock Crabs** (Rellekka/nearby coasts), **Sand Crabs** (Zeah/Hosidius), **Ammonite Crabs** (Fossil Island).  
- Notable items: better training weapons (upgrading to steel/iron → mithril/adamant scimitars as available) and quest reward gear.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: stable AFK training with crabs; aim toward 60 Attack/Defence thresholds for stronger weapons and NMZ optimisations.

### Level 50–70
- Main training methods: **Nightmare Zone (Normal Rumble)** for fast, semi-AFK XP; continued **crab** training; **Slayer** for varied, profitable combat XP.  
- Important locations: **Nightmare Zone** (Burthorpe), continued crab locations and Slayer areas.  
- Notable items: **Obsidian armour**, **Berserker necklace**, **Toktz-xil-ak** referenced as strong offensive options for NMZ-style training; **Dragon scimitar** as a major weapon upgrade at 60 Attack.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: hitting **60 Attack/Defence** for optimal NMZ/equipment combos and to wield key mid-tier weapons; start specialising Strength for best XP if gearing for NMZ.

### Level 70–99
- Main training methods: **Nightmare Zone** (high-efficiency AFK training) and **Slayer** (high-level tasks for combined Attack/Strength XP and profit). Use boss/monsters appropriate to your Slayer/gear for best hourly XP.  
- Important locations: **Nightmare Zone**, Slayer locations (Slayer Tower, relevant dungeons), high-level spawn areas (for gargoyles, rune dragons, etc.).  
- Notable items: **Abyssal whip** (major Attack weapon at **70 Attack**), **Culinaromancer's gloves** (Recipe for Disaster reward for offensive bonus), continued use of **Obsidian armour**/**Berserker necklace** or **Void** setups depending on strategy.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: reach **70 Attack** to wield the **Abyssal whip** (large DPS increase); prioritise Strength to 99 for maximal melee XP efficiency, then Attack and Defence as needed; use Slayer to transition into high‑value, high‑XP targets (e.g., **Gargoyles**, **Rune dragons** at high levels).
