Important training methods
- Multicombat stacking + multi-target damage (best XP):
  - Magic barrage spells (highest DPS when applicable).
  - Chinchompas (ranged multi-target).
  - Dinh's bulwark special attack (melee multi-target).
- Single- / small-group high-HP monsters:
  - Dwarf multicannon — strong for 1x1 and 2x2 monsters.
  - Venator bow — competitive with barrage for single-target tasks.
- Cannonable spots using ranged or melee when other multi-target options unavailable.
- Use Slayer reward points or low-level master (Turael) to skip/block undesirable tasks to maximize hour rates.
- Wear Slayer helmet (i) for best melee XP rates on Slayer tasks.
- Switch between two Slayer masters (one appropriate to level + a higher-level master) to take advantage of completion milestone point bonuses.

Quick efficiency notes (concise)
- Prefer multicombat areas and multi-target methods (barrage / chins / Dinh) for highest XP/hr.
- Use cannon or Venator bow for strong single-target tasks.
- Block/skip bad tasks with Slayer points or use low-level master to avoid inefficient assignments.
- Access to better masters (and quest/combat requirements) improves task pools and point gains — use higher masters when you can reliably complete tougher tasks.
