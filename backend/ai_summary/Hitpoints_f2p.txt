### Level 1–20
Train via **melee combat** on low-level monsters using the best weapon you can equip.  
- Main training methods: **Melee combat** (prefer **Aggressive** style for extra Strength XP / +3 hidden Strength).  
- Important locations: **Stronghold of Security** (early-safe area / reclaim boots).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Leather boots**, **Fancy boots / Fighting boots**, any basic cape, **Amulet of accuracy** if nothing better. Wear the best available melee armour for the enemy's attack type.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Raise **Attack** to unlock stronger scimitars (weapon progression leads to much higher DPS).

### Level 20–40
Continue melee training while upgrading armour and weapons as Attack permits.  
- Main training methods: **Melee combat** with upgraded weapons; prioritize **Strength** to increase max hit.  
- Important locations: continue safe low- to mid-level monster areas (use dungeons/nearby training spots appropriate to your combat levels).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Adamant scimitar** (when you meet its Attack requirement), **Amulet of power** (better accuracy/defence; use if Amulet of Strength unavailable), **Amulet of strength** when affordable. Use full **melee armour** vs melee monsters, **ranged armour** vs magic monsters; **chainbody** is preferable vs crush attackers.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Aim for **Attack 30** to use adamant scimitar and **Attack 40** to equip the major DPS upgrade (**Rune scimitar**).

### Level 40–60
Switch to high-DPS weapons and better armour; focus on efficient XP per hour.  
- Main training methods: **Melee combat** with high-speed, high-strength weapons (use **Aggressive** style when prioritizing Strength).  
- Important locations: specialist areas for tougher NPCs (use areas matching your Attack/Strength/Defence). **Ruins of Camdozaal** is notable for golems.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Rune scimitar** (primary free-to-play DPS weapon at Attack 40+), **Barronite mace** (strong alternative; has special effect vs runecrafting/body golems), **Amulet of strength** or **Amulet of power** depending on whether you need Strength or accuracy. Upgrade to **Rune platebody / Rune chainbody / Rune kiteshield** as Defence allows. Consider **decorative boots (red/white/gold)** from **Castle Wars** for better defence / small Strength bonus (gold boots give +1 Strength).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Reaching **Attack 40** and equipping the **Rune scimitar** is the main DPS milestone; decide whether to prioritise continued Strength training (higher max hit) or balancing Attack/Defence.

### Level 60+
Focus on maximising sustained DPS and tanking for AFK or high-efficiency spots.  
- Main training methods: high-level **melee combat** with best free-to-play gear; keep using **Aggressive** when Strength is the priority.  
- Important locations: higher‑level monster areas and multi-combat dungeons appropriate to your combined melee/Defence levels. Use **Castle Wars** for decorative boots if you want more defence/Strength over time.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Rune scimitar** remains best-in-slot; use **Amulet of strength** for max damage or **Amulet of power** for accuracy if needed. Equip best rune armour pieces available (**Rune chainbody / Rune platebody / Rune kiteshield**) and preferred capes/gloves. **Gilded d'hide vambraces** are best-in-slot for hands (require 40 Ranged); otherwise use **green d'hide vambraces** or **leather vambraces/gloves**.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Maintain melee skills within ~5–10 levels of each other for balanced survivability and damage; use temporary boosts (e.g., strength potions / beer) if available to raise max hit for short windows.
