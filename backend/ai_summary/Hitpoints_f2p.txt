Important training methods
- Use the fastest, highest-DPS weapons available — scimitars are best in F2P. Upgrade weapon as soon as you can equip the next tier (see levels below).
- Prioritise reaching 40 Attack to equip the rune scimitar (big DPS jump).
- Train Strength to increase max hit (use aggressive attack style for an effective +3 Strength).
- Equip whichever amulet gives the higher max hit: amulet of strength (+10 Melee Strength) if it increases your max hit, otherwise amulet of power (+6 Melee Strength) for better accuracy. Amulet of accuracy is a weaker interim option.
- Use appropriate armour: full melee armour vs melee monsters, ranged armour vs magic monsters. Use chainbody vs enemies that use crush (better crush defence).
- Use food and tanking armour if your Defence is lower than recommended for an area.
- Temporary boosts: strength potions/beer can temporarily raise Strength (e.g., potion can boost 99 → 111).

Relevant locations / item sources
- Stronghold of Security — reclaim fancy/fighting boots (starter boots).
- Castle Wars — decorative boots (red/white/gold) for better defence / +1 Strength (gold requires many tickets).
- Ruins of Camdozaal — barronite mace special (golembane) makes it best vs runecrafting golems.
- Imp Catcher (quest reward) / general shops — amulet of accuracy (early amulet alternative).

Quick thresholds to note
- Aim for Attack 40 to use rune scimitar — major DPS improvement.
- Aim for appropriate Defence milestones to wear better armour (20 / 30 / 40 Defence tiers).
- Prioritise Strength training to raise max hit; combine with amulet of strength / aggressive style for faster gains.
