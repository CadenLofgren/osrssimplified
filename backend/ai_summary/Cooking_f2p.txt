Summary — important training methods, locations, and levels (F2P Cooking)

Key training methods (with required Cooking level ± other requirements)
- Power-cook fish (fast, common F2P method)
  - Shrimp: cook at 1 Cooking (30 xp). Good starter; best net spot: Draynor.
  - Trout: cook at 15 Cooking (70 xp). Often caught with 20 Fishing; pick up dropped trout at Barbarian Village/Lumbridge.
  - Tuna: cook at 30 Cooking (100 xp). Harpooning requires 35 Fishing; main source: Musa Point (Karamja).
  - Lobster: cook at 40 Cooking (120 xp). Fish at Musa Point (40 Fishing).
  - Swordfish: cook at 45 Cooking (140 xp). Harpoon at Musa Point (50 Fishing). (Recommended to have higher Cooking to reduce burns.)
- Jugs of wine (fastest F2P Cooking XP)
  - Requires 35 Cooking to make unfermented wine → 200 xp per successful jug after fermentation.
  - Can be done en masse (buy jugs of water + grapes); fermentation can produce bad wine below level 68.
  - Cooks' Guild has jugs/grapes/water spawns (see Cooks' Guild below).
- Cooks' Guild mass production
  - Need 32 Cooking and a chef's hat to enter.
  - Free resources: jugs/pots/pie dishes/apples; ranges for mass apple pie production (apple pie requires 30 Cooking).
  - Also used for wine-making (jugs/grapes/water available).
- Complex food making (higher xp per item, sometimes profitable)
  - Redberry pie: 10 Cooking.
  - Meat pie: 20 Cooking.
  - Stew: 25 Cooking.
  - Plain pizza: 35 Cooking (pizza cooking gives 143 xp per success; good mid/late F2P training).
  - Anchovy pizza: 55 Cooking (adding anchovies to plain pizza is always successful).
- Alternate "no-burn" method
  - Use the highest-level food you can cook without burning (slower but zero losses). Useful if avoiding failed cooks; generally recommended only after reaching ~50 Cooking by other methods.

Relevant locations — what to use them for and any requirements
- Grand Exchange
  - Can light a fire one tile from the bank clerk (fast run/bank loops). Excellent for power-cooking fish and for bulk wine (buy/sell).
- Draynor Village
  - Persistent fire near the Friendly Forester; excellent short runs for shrimp/anchovies/power-cooking.
  - Range in Draynor Manor kitchen for some foods.
- Lumbridge (bank / castle)
  - Roof logs near bank for fast fires; castle kitchen range (requires Cook's Assistant quest). Good early-game.
- Al Kharid bank
  - Very short distance to range; fast bank/range loops for power-leveling.
- Varrock east & west banks
  - Ranges adjacent to banks; convenient for power-cooking.
- Edgeville
  - Range in Doris's house (members-only NPC house empty in F2P but range exists); common for lured/lower fishing runs and many player fires.
- Falador PVP bank (PVP world only)
  - Closest bank to a range; very fast runs but dangerous (PVP).
- Barbarian Village fishing spots
  - Trout/salmon spots with a permanent fire; often populated by power-fishers who drop raw fish to pick up and cook. Good early→mid training.
- Musa Point (Karamja)
  - Main free location for tuna, lobster, swordfish (harpooning); no permanent range — bring an axe + tinderbox or use other players' fires. Popular for dropped fish on busy worlds.
- Corsair Cove Resource Area
  - Useful alternative to Musa Point if you have Dragon Slayer I completed and ~30 Cooking / 35 Fishing; has a permanent campfire and banking access (after The Corsair Curse).
- Cooks' Guild (requires 32 Cooking + chef's hat)
  - Best location for apple pies and wine production; has free spawns of equipment, apples, jugs, and ranges for mass production.
- Gerrant's Fishy Business (Port Sarim)
  - Stocks raw sardines cheaply for low-level cooking practice (indoor fires possible).
