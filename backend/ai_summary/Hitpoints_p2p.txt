### Level 1–30
Train primarily by **questing** to skip slow early combat XP.
- Main methods: **Waterfall Quest** (instant 30 Attack/Strength), **Witch's House** (large Hitpoints XP), other recommended early quests for big melee XP.
- Important locations: quest areas (Witch's House, Waterfall Quest zones, Fight Arena, Tree Gnome Village).
- Notable items: none required; quests unlock access to better gear by raising Attack/Strength.
- Key unlocks/transitions: reaching 30 Attack/Strength after **Waterfall Quest** lets you equip mid-tier weapons and move to stronger monster training.

### Level 30–50
Focus on high-HP, low-defence monsters for AFK or semi-AFK HP gains.
- Main methods: **Rock Crabs**, **Sand/Ammonite Crabs**, **Ogres**, **Chaos druids**, **Moss giants**.
- Important locations: crab camps and common low‑agro monster areas (Rock Crabs, Sand/Ammonite Crab locations, ogre camps).
- Notable items: upgraded melee weapon (based on Attack level), basic food and teleport tablets for safety.
- Key unlocks/transitions: reaching 60 Attack/Defence requirements (via quests or training) opens best-in-slot weapons and better armour options for more efficient training.

### Level 50–70
Switch toward efficient, higher‑XP, semi-AFK methods and minigames.
- Main methods: **Nightmare Zone (Normal Rumble)** for high, safe XP; continued crab/camp training if preferred; **Pest Control** (until 70+ combat) for steady XP and rewards.
- Important locations: **Nightmare Zone** (minigame), Pest Control ports.
- Notable items: **Obsidian armour**, **Berserker necklace**, **Toktz-xil-ak** recommended for Nightmare Zone setups; **Culinaromancer's gloves** (if unlocked) improve melee DPS.
- Key unlocks/transitions: efficient NMZ setups require maintaining Attack/Defence minimums for chosen weapons — once you can use the best training weapon, prioritize Strength gains for peak XP rates.

### Level 70–99
Maximise XP with endgame training and Slayer integration.
- Main methods: **Nightmare Zone** (optimal for AFK, high XP at 70+), **Slayer** tasks (Gargoyles and other profitable high‑XP tasks), **Scurrius / Sulphur Naguas** and high‑level monster camps; **Rune dragons** at 90+ for high risk/reward training.
- Important locations: **Nightmare Zone**, high‑level Slayer/dungeon locations, Rune dragon lairs.
- Notable items: best‑in‑slot melee **weapons** for your Attack level, **Obsidian armour + Berserker necklace + Toktz-xil-ak** NMZ combo; **Culinaromancer's gloves** and other quest rewards to boost DPS; consider **Void** or Barrows sets depending on style and budget.
- Key unlocks/transitions: prioritize Strength to 99 first for fastest melee XP, then Attack and Defence; use Slayer to combine combat training with profit and access to better training monsters (e.g., Gargoyles).
