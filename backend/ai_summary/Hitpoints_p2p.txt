Summary — important training methods, locations, and level/requirement notes

General notes
- Complete high-XP melee quests early to skip slow low-level training and unlock better equipment (Waterfall Quest + Witch's House are high priority).
- Maintain balanced melee stats until you can use best-in-slot weapon/equipment; then prioritise Strength for fastest melee XP.
- Strength can be trained without raising Hitpoints via barbarian fishing, and the Blast Furnace pump (requires 30 Strength).
- Defence alternatives: use Ancient Magicks with defensive spells or chinchompas (long fuse on Manical monkeys) for better Defence XP than melee in some cases.
- Slayer tasks are efficient for simultaneous Slayer/combat training and often profitable.
- Bring an emergency teleport (tablet or runes) when fighting dangerous monsters.

Other training locations/methods mentioned (from content shown)
- Crabs (Rock Crabs / similar) — referenced in TOC for levels 30–50 (content cut off), commonly used at mid-levels.
- Slayer tasks and specific monsters (e.g., dagannoth, brine rats, spiritual creatures) — unlocks via quests make Slayer training viable.
- Nightmare Zone / NMZ (referenced in general notes / TOC) — noted as a top method for 50+ and 70+ ranges in TOC (detailed strategy not included in supplied content).

Quick actionable progression (based on supplied content)
1. Do key quests first: Waterfall Quest (instant 30 Attack/Strength) and Witch’s House (Hitpoints boost).
2. Finish other recommended early quests (Fight Arena, Tree Gnome Village, Death Plateau, Vampyre Slayer, Tai Bwo Wannai Trio) to reach ~Attack 45 / Strength 37 / Defence 31 without grinding.
3. From ~30 Attack/Strength, use crabs / slayer / mid-level training methods (Rock Crabs referenced for 30–60 in TOC).
4. At higher levels, unlock/consider quests like Dragon Slayer I, Heroes' Quest, Haunted Mine and NMZ (TOC) for faster progression to 70+ and 99.
