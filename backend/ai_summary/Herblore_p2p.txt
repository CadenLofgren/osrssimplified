Summary — concise Herblore (p2p) training extract

Important training methods
- Making potions (primary method)
  - Combine unfinished (base) potions with secondary ingredients.
  - Fastest approach: add secondaries to unfinished potions (if banking quickly ≈ 2,500 potions/hour).
  - Some potions (serum 207s, stamina, extended antifires, anti-venoms, extended super antifire, etc.) can be manually sped to 1 tick each for up to ~4,583 potions/hour.
  - Decanting 4-dose potions is assumed for pricing/efficiency.
- Herb cleaning
  - Cleaning grimy herbs is slower but can be profitable.
- Quest experience
  - Several quests give useful Herblore XP early on (can be used to jumpstart training).

Useful items that affect training
- Alchemist's amulet / Amulet of chemistry — saves on ingredient cost (uses charges).
- Prescription goggles — 10% chance to not consume secondary ingredients for most potions (saves cost).

Relevant locations (from the page)
- Grand Exchange — market pricing / buy-sell of ingredients and potions.
- Bank locations (general) — needed for frequent banking/decanting to maintain high production rates.
- Quest-related areas (for quest XP): locations associated with listed quests (Jungle Potion, Recruitment Drive, The Dig Site, Shades of Mort'ton, etc.).

Quick recommendations
- Use quests with XP rewards to reach early milestones (3→19 via Jungle Potion, Recruitment Drive, The Dig Site).
- Train primarily by making potions (unfinished + secondaries) for fastest XP; use frequent banking/decanting to sustain rates.
- If concerned about gp, clean grimy herbs or use alchemist/chemistry amulets and prescription goggles to reduce ingredient cost.
