### Level 1–20
- Main training methods: **Complete Druidic Ritual** to start Herblore (unlocks level 3), then train by **making low‑level potions**—notably **Attack (lvl 3)**, **Antipoison (lvl 5)**, **Strength (lvl 12)** and **Serum 207 (lvl 15)**. Fastest XP is gained by **adding secondary ingredients to unfinished potions**.  
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange** (buy ingredients), **Bank** (bank/decant potions).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Vial of water**, **Unfinished potions**, **Eye of newt**, **Unicorn horn dust**, **Limpwurt root**, **Ashes**; **Alchemist's amulet** / **Amulet of chemistry** and **Prescription goggles** for cost savings.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Quest XP from **Jungle Potion**, **Recruitment Drive** and **The Dig Site** can push you from Herblore 3 → ~19 quickly.

### Level 20–40
- Main training methods: Continue **making potions** with higher‑level unfinished potions (examples: **Compost (22)**, **Restore (22+)**). Consider **cleaning grimy herbs** as a profitable but slower alternative.  
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange**, **Bank** (keep stocked and decant into multi‑dose pots for efficiency).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Volcanic ash**, **Red spiders' eggs**, other secondary ingredients relevant to mid‑level potions; keep using **Alchemist's amulet / Amulet of chemistry** and **Prescription goggles**.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Access to more XP‑dense potions at level 22+ and quest rewards (e.g., **Shades of Mort'ton**) help bridge early‑mid levels.

### Level 40–60
- Main training methods: Prioritize **potions with the best XP/hr** for your budget (make base + secondary on unfinished potions and decant to 4‑dose when possible). Use **herb cleaning** only if aiming for profit.  
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange** for bulk ingredient purchases, **Bank** for frequent banking/decanting.  
- Notable equipment/items: Continue **Alchemist's amulet / Amulet of chemistry**, **Prescription goggles**; use **vials of blood** or **coconut milk** where required by specific recipes.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: At these levels you unlock many high‑XP potions and can optimize cost vs XP (decanting and amulet/goggles combinations significantly change profitability).

### Level 60+
- Main training methods: Make the highest XP/time potions available (focus on potions that maximize XP/hr or fit your budget). Use advanced methods like **decanting to 4‑dose potions** and, for certain potions, **manual 1‑tick crafting** to speed production.  
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange** and **Bank** remain central for supply and decanting; use any high‑capacity bank/GE access for efficient mass crafting.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Alchemist's amulet**, **Amulet of chemistry**, **Prescription goggles** — combine these to reduce ingredient consumption/cost; higher‑tier secondary ingredients unlocked at higher levels.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: At **level 60+** you can access more efficient high‑level potions and, if desired, pursue **Mastering Mixology** techniques (60+/81+ thresholds referenced for specialized methods). Typical throughput: ~**2,500 potions/hour** with standard methods; **manual 1‑tick** methods for specific potions can reach ~**4,583 potions/hour**.
