### Level 1–20
Train via **questing** to skip early levels (quests like **Biohazard**, **Hazeel Cult**, **Fight Arena**, **Tower of Life**, **Tribal Totem** give early Thieving XP).  
Main training methods
- **Questing** for early XP boosts (can get to ~24–42 Thieving with a set of low-requirement quests).  
Important locations
- **Lumbridge** / starter quest areas for quest content.  
Notable equipment or items
- General pickpocketing quality: enable **Hidden** NPC Attack option to make **Pickpocket** left-click.  
Key unlocks or transitions
- Complete early Thieving quests to skip to mid-level content quickly.

### Level 20–40
Main training methods
- Continue **questing** to reach 42 (several quests collectively grant large XP gains).  
- Optional: begin **Chambers of Xeric thieving room** training for high XP if you can access raids.  
Important locations
- **Chambers of Xeric** (Mount Quidamortem, Kebos Lowlands) — thieving room spawns chests.  
Notable equipment or items
- **Lockpick** (used in raid/artefact/chest methods).  
Key unlocks or transitions
- Quarry for switching to chest/raid-based methods; raids allow high XP from low levels if accessible.

### Level 36–45
Main training methods
- **Chests in Aldarin Villas** (fastest at 36–45) — pick locks for 200 XP each.  
- Continue **Chambers of Xeric thieving room** if available.  
Important locations
- **Aldarin Villas** (western villa has shortest run on failure).  
- **Chambers of Xeric** thieving room.  
Notable equipment or items
- **Lockpick** required for villa chests.  
Key unlocks or transitions
- At level 45 you can transition to **blackjacking** (requires level 45 Thieving and partial completion of **The Feud**).

### Level 45–65
Main training methods
- **Blackjacking** bandits in **Pollnivneach** (45–49 optimal, then again stronger at 65+) — highest single-target XP when mastered.  
- **Stealing artefacts** in **Port Piscarilius** (fast from 49–65; less click-intensive than blackjacking).  
Important locations
- **Pollnivneach** (Ali the dyer’s house, northern houses, southern area for thugs).  
- **Port Piscarilius** (houses assigned by **Captain Khaled**).  
Notable equipment or items
- **Blackjack** (any type) for blackjacking.  
- **Saradomin brews** / **jugs of wine** or other inventory-blocking food for blackjacking.  
- **Book of the Dead** / **Kharedst’s memoirs** and **stamina potions** for artefacts.  
- **Rogue equipment** (unlocked at level 50 for faster loot, not XP) improves loot, not XP.  
- **Dodgy necklace**, **Shadow Veil**, **Gloves of Silence** (increase survival/success while pickpocketing).  
Key unlocks or transitions
- Level 49–50 enables better stealing artefacts and **rogue equipment** access (rogue outfit completed via Rogues' Den minigame).
- Blackjacking requires partial completion of **The Feud**.

### Level 65–84
Main training methods
- Continue **blackjacking** (Menaphite Thugs at 65+ for very high XP/hr).  
- **Stealing artefacts** remains viable and semi-AFK.  
Important locations
- **Pollnivneach** for thugs; **Port Piscarilius** for artefacts.  
Notable equipment or items
- **Inventory-blocking food** (brews/wine/pies) to keep inventory full during blackjacking.  
- **Rogue equipment** (double loot chance; full set guarantees double loot).  
Key unlocks or transitions
- As Thieving increases, artefacts and blackjacking XP rates scale up; at higher levels consider switching to endgame methods (Rogues' Castle, Pyramid Plunder).

### Level 84–99
Main training methods
- **Stealing from Rogues' Castle chests** (deep **Wilderness**) — fastest XP when willing to risk PK.  
- **Pyramid Plunder** (best after level 91; viable alternative at 71/81) — high XP in Sophanem.  
- **Stealing artefacts** and high-level blackjacking remain options depending on playstyle.  
Important locations
- **Rogues' Castle** (deep Wilderness; chest near north wall).  
- **Pyramid Plunder** (Sophanem).  
- **Port Piscarilius** (artefacts) as an alternative.  
Notable equipment or items
- **Protect from Melee** prayer for Rogues' Castle runs.  
- **Looting bag** optional for Wilderness runs.  
- **Pharaoh's sceptre** or completion of **Icthlarin's Little Helper** to access **Pyramid Plunder**.  
- **High-healing food**, **stamina potions**, **antipoison** (e.g., **araxyte venom sacks**) for Pyramid Plunder.  
Key unlocks or transitions
- Level 91 unlocks peak efficiency for **Pyramid Plunder** (fastest minigame XP outside Wilderness).  
- Wilderness methods require risk tolerance; Rogues' Castle gives top XP if unmanaged PK risk is acceptable.

General persistent mechanics (relevant across levels)
- **Ardougne Diary** (medium/hard) increases pickpocket success within Ardougne / globally and raises coin pouch capacity — useful for sustained pickpocketing.  
- **Rogue equipment** increases loot (double on full set) but does not increase XP.  
- **Dodgy necklace** and **Shadow Veil** reduce stun/damage on failed pickpockets; **Gloves of Silence** give +5% pickpocket success (can degrade).
