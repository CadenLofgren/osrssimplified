Efficient training methods, locations, and required levels

Levels 1–10
- Doric’s Quest reward: 1,300 Mining XP (takes you to level 10).
  - Requires having 6 clay, 4 copper ore, 2 iron ore (iron can be bought if you can’t mine it — needs 15 Mining to mine).

Levels 1/10–15
- Copper/Tin mining (17.5 XP per ore) to 15 Mining.
  - Best casual locations: East Lumbridge Swamp mine, northern Dwarven Mines.
  - If banking ores: South-east Varrock mine → bank in eastern Varrock bank.

Levels 15–99
- Iron ore (35 XP each) — fastest and primary F2P training method from 15+.
  - Best locations: Al Kharid Mine (only free-to-play 3-rock tile where one tile is surrounded by 3 iron rocks; has aggressive level-14 scorpions), Citharede Abbey mine (good for tick-manipulation 4-tick cycling).
  - Technique: drop ores for maximum XP; mine 3 rocks in a rotation to eliminate travel time.
  - Important thresholds:
    - 41 Mining + rune pickaxe: smooth 3-ore cycling (face-back trick).
    - 61 Mining: effective 100% harvest success on iron (maxes respawn cycle).

Money-making oriented methods (levels and locations)
- Superheat Item (requires Magic 43 + relevant Smithing level)
  - Use to smelt as you mine (reduces banking), useful when mining coal.
  - Good coal locations: Barbarian Village mine (closest when using imbued Skull sceptre), Mining Guild, West Lumbridge Swamp, South-west Wilderness mine, Dwarven mine. Bank with Falador teleport for Barbarian Village route.
- Adamantite ore (70 Mining)
  - Best: Mining Guild (two rocks), bank at east Falador. World-hopping speeds gathering.
- Runite ore (85 Mining)
  - Only free-to-play runite rocks: Lava Maze runite mine in the Wilderness (dangerous). World-hopping recommended; very slow but highly profitable.

Other/AFK methods
- Rune essence (requires Rune Mysteries progression)
  - Mine at rune essence mine; very AFK but slow XP (5 XP per essence). Useful early for Runecraft or if you want AFK Mining.
- Crashed stars (Shooting Stars) — usable from level 10+
  - Very AFK but low XP/hour; F2P stars are rare — join sharing groups or use plugins to locate.
- Barronite shards & deposits (requires completing Below Ice Mountain to access Ruins of Camdozaal)
  - Levels 14+; shards = 16 XP each, deposits = 32 XP each. Slower than iron but much more AFK-friendly; buffs (Charm of Mining / Charm of Boost) improve rates.

Quick tips
- Always use the best pickaxe you can wield.
- Drop lower-value ores while training (especially iron) to maximize XP/hour unless you’re using a money-making method (adamant/runite/superheat).
- For high-speed iron training, position/mine cycles (3-rock spots, tick manipulation) matter more than location distance to bank.
