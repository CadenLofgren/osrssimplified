### Level 1–20
- Main training methods: **Craft leather items** (make the highest-level leather item available).
- Important locations: **Lumbridge**/any bank for buying leather and banking.
- Notable equipment/items: **Needle**, **Thread**, **Leather**.
- Key notes/transitions: Thread is required (~50 thread to reach 20); craft progressively higher leather (gloves → boots → cowl → vambraces → body) and then transition to **gem cutting** or other money-making/XP methods at 20+.

### Level 20–62/77/99
- Main training methods: **Cut (uncut) gems** (sapphires → emeralds → rubies → diamonds → dragonstones).
- Important locations: Any bank + nearby crafting spot for gem cutting; use the Grand Exchange to buy uncut gems.
- Notable equipment/items: **Uncut gems** (sapphire, emerald, ruby, diamond, dragonstone).
- Key unlocks/transitions: Gem cutting is the fastest method up to ~77. Common progression: cut **diamonds** to ~62 then switch to **battlestaves**; alternatively cut **rubies** to ~58 then do **earth battlestaves**. **Dragonstones** give high XP but are extremely costly; **onyx/zenyte** are generally impractical.

### Level 54–77/99
- Main training methods: **Craft battlestaves** (water/earth/fire/air battlestaves).
- Important locations: Buy battlestaves from the **Grand Exchange**; note reduced-price daily noted battlestaves from **Zaff** (requires Varrock diary).
- Notable equipment/items: **Battlestaffs**, option to **High Level Alchemy** to recoup cost and gain Magic XP (requires fire staff or equivalent).
- Key notes/transitions: Battlestaves give competitive XP often comparable to d'hide bodies; choose battlestaves or d'hides based on current GE prices and available capital. Varrock Diary discounts can significantly reduce supply cost.

### Level 63/77–99
- Main training methods: **Craft d'hide bodies** (green at 63, blue at 71, red at 77, black at 84).
- Important locations: **Gnome Stronghold south bank** (tick-manip method described); any bank with good deposit/banking setup.
- Notable equipment/items: **Needle** + **Thread**, **Costume needle** (craft 9 d'hide bodies per inventory instead of 8), **Deposit lock** bank option, **High Level Alchemy** for cost recovery.
- Key unlocks/transitions: Start **green d'hide** at 63 or **blue** at 71; d'hide bodies become the fastest viable method from ~77 onward. Use **costume needle** and tick manipulation (see Gnome Stronghold south bank technique) to maximize hourly rates; alching d'hide bodies can lower net cost.

### Level 1–83/99 (Other method)
- Main training methods: **Blow molten glass** (make vials, orbs, lantern lenses, etc.).
- Important locations: Any **furnace**; minimal travel makes it low-attention AFK-friendly.
- Notable equipment/items: **Glassblowing pipe**, **Molten glass**, specific target items like **Unpowered orb**.
- Key notes/transitions: Very low attention and capital requirement but slow XP; useful for semi-AFK training or when capital is limited.

### Level 5–99 (Other method)
- Main training methods: **Craft jewellery** with **gold bars** and gem moulds (rings, necklaces, amulets, bracelets).
- Important locations: Best furnace/bank setups are **Prifddinas** (ideal), **Edgeville**, or **Shilo Village furnace** (closest to a bank but charges a small fee).
- Notable equipment/items: **Gold bar**, appropriate **moulds**, gems (if making gem jewellery), weight-reducing clothing for run efficiency.
- Key notes/transitions: Jewellery is steady XP and can be profitable depending on item and market; use best bank-to-furnace route for fastest crafting; stringing or alching options affect XP/hour and profit.
