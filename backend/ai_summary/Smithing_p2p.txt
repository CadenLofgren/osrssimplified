### Level 1–20
- Main training methods: **Quest experience** (complete Smithing XP reward quests) or **anvil smithing** (make highest-level bronze/iron items available).  
- Important locations: **Anvil south of Varrock west bank** (closest bank-anvil).  
- Notable items/equipment: basic **bronze bars**, **bronze daggers/scimitars/warhammers/platebodies** as early smiting choices.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: completing Smithing XP quests can skip early levels (large XP from quests such as **The Knight's Sword**).

### Level 20–40
- Main training methods: **Anvil smithing** (make the highest-level item you can to maximize XP/hr). Consider smithing **iron platebodies** to reach 40 quickly.  
- Important locations: **Varrock anvil** (south of west Varrock bank) — best anvil for banking; alternate anvils: **Yanille** (slightly farther), **Prifddinas (Trahaearn district)** if unlocked.  
- Notable items/equipment: **iron bars**, **iron platebody** (used commonly to hit level 40).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: reaching **level 40 Smithing** unlocks access to **Blast Furnace gold bar** training; questing remains a cheap way to skip to ~39–40.

### Level 40–99
- Main training methods:
  - Primary: **Blast Furnace — smelting gold bars** (fastest viable XP from 40+). Use optimized banking (0-tick) or runners for peak rates.  
  - Alternatives: **Giants' Foundry** (for lower-effort, consistent XP and rewards), **Blast Furnace smelting other bars** (iron/steel/etc.) for profit, and niche methods like **smithing dart tips** (20+), **cannonballs** (35+), **armour smithing** (48+), and **3-bar rune items** (95/98+).  
- Important locations: **Blast Furnace (Keldagrim)** — access via **The Giant Dwarf** quest start or **minecart/Grouping teleport** from Grand Exchange; use **official Blast Furnace worlds** for foreman-run operation; **Giants' Foundry** minigame location for sword forging; **Prifddinas** anvil for faster anvil banking if available.  
- Notable items/equipment:
  - **Goldsmith gauntlets** (major XP boost for gold bars — requires **Family Crest**).  
  - **Ice gloves** (speed up bar collection at Blast Furnace; requires level 50 Mining (boostable) and Ice Queen).  
  - **Stamina potions**, **weight-reducing clothing**, **Ring of endurance** (to preserve run energy), **coal bag** (for non-gold Blast Furnace smelting).  
  - **Smiths' Uniform** and **improved moulds** (for **Giants' Foundry** efficiency and XP).  
- Key unlocks/transitions:
  - Start **The Giant Dwarf** to access **Keldagrim/Blast Furnace**.  
  - Complete **Family Crest** to use **goldsmith gauntlets** (huge XP/hr uplift on gold).  
  - Obtain **ice gloves** and **coal bag** for optimal Blast Furnace performance.  
  - In **Giants' Foundry**, buy **improved moulds** then **Smiths' Uniform** for better sword quality and XP; Foundry requires **Sleeping Giants** completion.  
- Notes on technique/performance:
  - Blast Furnace gold method: deposit ore to fill dispenser, smelt, equip **ice gloves** after each smelt to grab bars, bank, repeat; use **0-tick banking** and locked bank slots/placeholders for max efficiency.  
  - Runners (1–3) drastically increase XP/hr (but are extremely costly and require tight coordination).  
  - For non-gold bars at the Blast Furnace, recommended to use **coal bag**, **ice gloves**, and official worlds to maximize bars/hr and profit.
