Important training methods
- Bury bones (baseline method). Simple, no quest or item requirements.
- Use bones on an altar (gives increased Prayer XP compared to burying). No members-only content required for the Lumbridge church altar.

Relevant locations / bone sources
- Chickens — Lumbridge chicken coops (ideal for absolute beginners).
- Cows — Lumbridge cow field (easy, low‑risk source of bones).
- Goblins — around Lumbridge/various beginner areas.
- Skeletons — Lumbridge graveyard / other skeleton spawn areas (better bone drops than chickens/cows).
- Altar for bonus XP: Lumbridge Church altar (bones can be used on the altar for the altar XP bonus).

Levels required
- Prayer level: 1 to bury bones or use bones on an altar (no higher Prayer level required).
- Combat level / requirements: depends on the monster you kill to obtain bones (low combat for chickens/cows/goblins; skeletons may require slightly higher combat).

Notes for efficient training
- Collect bones from the nearest low‑level monsters (chickens/cows/goblins/skeletons) and use them on the Lumbridge church altar when convenient for extra XP.
- No special items or quests are required in free‑to‑play for these methods.
