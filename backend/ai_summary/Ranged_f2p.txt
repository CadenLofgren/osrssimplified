### Level 1–20
Train on **seagulls**, **cows**, **goblins**, **chickens**, or **monks** for fast early XP (very low defence targets).

- Main training methods: kill low-defence monsters (safe, fast kills); **safespot** cows across fences.
- Important locations: **Port Sarim** / **Corsair Cove** (seagulls), area east/north of **Lumbridge Castle** (cows, goblins, chickens).
- Notable equipment/items: **Shortbow** → upgrade to **Oak shortbow** at level 5; arrows: **bronze arrows** → **iron arrows** (use cheapest arrow that gives the same max hit).
- Key unlocks/transitions: **Oak shortbow** at Ranged 5; consider using **Accurate** only at very low levels if +3 Ranged raises max hit (briefly useful); otherwise use **Rapid** once attack speed matters.

### Level 20–40
Shift to higher-HP/XP monsters and better bows/arrows.

- Main training methods: fight mid‑HP monsters for efficient XP (e.g., **Hill giants**, **moss/giant** variants as you approach higher levels).
- Important locations: **Edgeville Dungeon** (Hill giants), continued use of **Lumbridge**/other low-level monster spots if crowded.
- Notable equipment/items: **Willow shortbow** unlocked at Ranged 20; **Maple shortbow** at Ranged 30; arrows: **steel arrows** (Oak+), **mithril arrows** (Willow+). Keep using the cheapest arrow that maintains your max hit.
- Key unlocks/transitions: **Willow shortbow** at Ranged 20; **Maple shortbow** at Ranged 30; switch to **mithril**/then **adamant** arrows when they increase your max hit. Use **Rapid** for better DPS once +1 max-hit bumps are no longer efficient.

### Level 40+
Train on higher-HP, higher-defence monsters for sustained XP; upgrade armour and arrows.

- Main training methods: kill higher-level slayer-type monsters and mid/high-level giants/spiders/demons (e.g., **Moss giants**, **Flesh Crawlers**, **Giant spiders**, **Ogresses**, **Lesser demons**, **Ankou**).
- Important locations: **Edgeville Dungeon** and other mid/high-level monster locations (use specific monster spawn areas that match your target).
- Notable equipment/items: **Maple shortbow** (best standard bow available in F2P) with **adamant arrows** when they raise max hit; best armour options include **Gilded d'hide** / **Green d'hide** pieces (bodies, chaps, vambraces) or **studded/leather** sets as budget alternatives; **Amulet of power/accuracy** and **leather boots/vambraces**.
- Key unlocks/transitions: aim for Ranged 40 for best d'hide pieces (BIS armour in free-to-play); prioritize upgrading arrow tier only when it increases your max hit (otherwise use cheaper arrows); use **Rapid** attack style for sustained DPS — avoid **Longrange** for training (it splits XP and wastes arrows).
