Zero-time methods (can be trained while doing other activities)
- Darts (very click-efficient; buy dart tips + feathers on the Grand Exchange)
  - Bronze darts — level 10

  - Steel — level 37
  - Mithril — level 52
  - Adamant — level 67
  - Rune — level 81
  - Amethyst — level 90
  - Dragon — level 95
  - Notes: 2-click methods available; good for passive training while questing, Agility, Hunter, farm runs, Slayer, Wintertodt. Mobile two-finger tapping speeds this up.
- Bolts (attaching feathers to unfinished bolts; lower XP/action than darts)
  - Bronze bolts — level 9
  - Blurite — level 24
  - Iron — level 39
  - Silver — level 43
  - Steel — level 46

  - Adamant — level 61
  - Rune — level 69
  - Dragon — level 84
  - Notes: materials commonly bought on the Grand Exchange.

Semi-zero methods (periodic requeueing; actions occur every 2 ticks)
- Tipping bolts (adding gem/metal tips to bolts)
  - Opal-tipped bronze — level 11
  - Jade-tipped blurite — level 26
  - Pearl-tipped iron — level 41
  - Topaz-tipped steel — level 48
  - Barbed bolts — level 51
  - Notes: requires more capital and checking GE supply/buy limits; gives steady XP in sets.

Other notable methods (level ranges only)
- Headless arrows — level 1–5
- Arrow shafts — level 1–5 (or to 10 depending on method/settings)
- Bows (stringing/crafting bows) — level 5–99
- Battlestaves (fletching related processing) — level 40–80
- Redwood shields — level 92–99

Relevant locations and tips
- Grand Exchange — primary place to buy dart tips, feathers, unfinished bolts, bolt tips, and other materials.
- Zero-time contexts: questing, Agility courses, Hunter (non-black creatures), farm runs, Slayer tasks, Wintertodt, etc.
- The Tourist Trap quest is not required to fletch darts (only for smithing dart tips).
- Mobile two-finger tapping can speed up zero-time dart fletching.

Use darts for fastest passive XP per click; bolts / tipped bolts are alternatives depending on prices and buy limits; use quests to skip early levels.
