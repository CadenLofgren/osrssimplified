### Level 1–20
Train on **raw shrimps** / **raw anchovies** with a **small fishing net** (net fishing) or use **sardines/herring** with a **fishing rod + bait** (bait fishing).

- Main training methods: **Net fishing** (shrimp/anchovy) or **Bait fishing** (sardine/herring).

- Notable equipment/items: **Small fishing net**, **Fishing rod**, **Bait**.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: **Level 5** allows **sardines**, **level 10** unlocks **herring**, **level 15** enables **anchovies** (anchovies give higher XP). Move to **fly fishing** at level 20.

### Level 20–40
Use **fly fishing** for **trout** (and **salmon** once unlocked) with a **fly fishing rod + feathers**; either **drop** fish for max XP or **cook** them on‑spot for Cooking XP and food.
