Summary — Free-to-play Fishing (important methods, locations, levels)

Levels 1–20
- Raw shrimps / raw anchovies (Small fishing net)
  - Req: Fishing 1; anchovies require Fishing 15 to start appearing.
  - Locations: Al Kharid (close to bank), Draynor Village (banking spot south of bank), SW of Port Sarim (near Gerrant's Fishy Business for selling).
  - Notes: Fast early XP. Drop for best XP; bank if profit desired.

Levels 5–20 (alternative)
- Raw sardines / raw herring (Fishing rod + bait)
  - Req: Fishing 5 for sardine, Fishing 10 for herring.
  - Locations: Bait/rod fishing spots (same low-level coastal spots; small fishing spot recommended).
  - Notes: Faster than nets once herring is unlocked.

Levels 20–40 / 20–99
- Raw trout / raw salmon (Fly fishing with fly rod + feathers)
  - Req: Fishing 20 for trout; Fishing 30 for salmon.
  - Locations: Lumbridge, Barbarian Village.
  - Notes: Best free-to-play method to 99 when dropfishing. Feathers consumed per catch (~600 from 20–40; very large amount to 99). Options: drop raw for max XP or cook on nearby fire (Barbarian permanent fire or make a fire) to bank or gain Cooking XP. Various banking/canoe methods (Ferox Enclave canoe option requires 57 Woodcutting) exist to reduce running.

Levels 15–39 (profit-focused)
- Raw shrimps / raw anchovies (Small net) — profit method
  - Req: Fishing 15+ to get anchovies.
  - Best location: Draynor Village.
  - Notes: Drop cheaper fish, bank the valuable ones. Expect ~150–280 fish/hour.

Levels 40–49
- Raw lobster (Lobster pot)
  - Req: Fishing 40.
  - Location: Musa Point (Karamja).
  - Notes: ~12,600 Fishing XP/hr and ~20k gp/hr. Banking requires boat to Port Sarim (30 coins one-way) or Corsair Cove Resource Area if you completed The Corsair Curse and Dragon Slayer I.

Levels 50–99
- Raw tuna / raw swordfish (Harpoon)
  - Req: Fishing 35 for tuna, 50 for swordfish.
  - Location: Harpoon spot at Musa Point (Karamja).
  - Notes: High gp & XP. Options: drop lower-value fish, sell at Karamja General Store for convenience, or cook on-site for more XP (bring axe/tinderbox/logs).

Other method (useful for Prayer/Cooking)
- Ruins of Camdozaal (small net + prepare + offer)
  - Req: Quest: Below Ice Mountain (access); Fishing/Cooking 7 to catch/prepare guppy; 33 Fishing & 33 Cooking to use tetra.
  - Location: Ruins of Camdozaal.
  - Notes: Slower Fishing XP than trout/salmon but trains Cooking and Prayer (prepare fish at table then offer at altar). Tetra stop ruining at Cooking 61 (or ~54 if you buy the Preparation buff).
