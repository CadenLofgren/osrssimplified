### Level 1–20
Train Strength by doing **melee combat on low‑level monsters** (e.g. **chickens**, **cows**, **goblins**) near starter towns like **Lumbridge**.  
- Main training methods: **Aggressive attack style** for Strength XP (adds +3 effective Strength), kill low‑HP monsters for fast kills and easy sustenance.  
- Important locations: **Lumbridge** area, starter farms/areas with chickens/cows.  
- Notable equipment/items: **leather boots**, **fancy/fighting boots** (Stronghold of Security reward), any basic cape, **leather gloves/vambraces**. Use the best scimitar you can equip (bronze → iron → steel).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: begin saving/upgrading weapons; aim to raise **Attack** toward 40 to access the best free‑to‑play weapon.

### Level 20–40
Focus on faster XP targets and upgrade gear as Attack permits.  
- Main training methods: **Melee combat on mid‑level monsters** that you can reliably kill without dying; continue using **aggressive** where safe to maximise Strength XP.  
- Important locations: move to multi‑spawn/denser areas appropriate to your combat level (common F2P spots used at this range).  
- Notable equipment/items: upgrade to **mithril**/**adamant scimitars** as Attack allows; use **amulet of accuracy** until you can obtain an **amulet of power** or **amulet of strength**; wear improved melee armour (chainbody/platebody as available).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: reach **40 Attack** to equip the **Rune scimitar** (major DPS upgrade); keep Defence within ~5–10 levels of your offensive stats or bring more/better food.

### Level 40+
Prioritise getting and using the **Rune scimitar** and optimise for maximum hit.  
- Main training methods: high‑throughput melee combat using the **Rune scimitar** (best DPS in F2P); prioritise Strength training to raise your max hit.  
- Important locations: high‑spawn, safe training areas appropriate to your level (use areas that allow sustained melee), and niche locations such as the **Ruins of Camdozaal** for golem content (see below).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Rune scimitar** (best DPS), **amulet of strength** (best for max hit) or **amulet of power** (better accuracy/defence when Strength bonus doesn't improve max hit), **rune chainbody/platebody**, **rune kiteshield**, and improved boots/capes (decorative boots from **Castle Wars** grant +1 Strength but require many tickets). **Barronite mace** is the second‑best weapon and has a golembane effect useful specifically against runecrafting/body golems.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: equipping the **Rune scimitar** at **40 Attack** is the main transition; note attack styles and amulet bonuses (aggressive = +3 Strength, **amulet of power** = +6, **amulet of strength** = +10) directly affect maximum hit. At high Strength levels, temporary boosts (e.g. **strength potion**) raise effective Strength above 99 for higher max hits.
