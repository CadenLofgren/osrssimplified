### Level 1–30
Train on **Poison karambwan (1‑tick)** or basic **fish** depending on risk/effort.

- Main training methods  
  - **1‑tick Poison karambwan** (fastest; very click‑intensive) — hold a key (1/space) and rapidly use **raw karambwan** on a fire/range.  
  - **Cooking fish** (cheaper, less clicky): **Sardine → Herring → Mackerel → Trout → Pike → Salmon** progression. Buy ~2.5× more raw fish than needed due to high early burn rates.
- Important locations  
  - Any convenient **fire/range** for early cooking. (No special location required for poison karambwan.)
- Notable equipment / items  
  - **Raw karambwan** (buy large stack; high burn rate at low levels).  
  - Various **raw fish** per level range.
- Key unlocks / transitions  
  - **Poison karambwan** has no requirements.  
  - To cook **cooked karambwan** later you must complete **Tai Bwo Wannai Trio** (required after 30 for cooked karambwan method).

### Level 30–68
Shift toward high‑speed methods or reliable AFK fish cooking.

- Main training methods  
  - **Cooked karambwan (1‑tick)** — highest XP rate if you can 1‑tick reliably.  
  - **Cooking fish**: **Tuna** then **Lobster** (cheap/profitable AFK option).  
  - **Bake Pie** (if you have **Lunar Diplomacy**) is an alternative from level 10 onward.
- Important locations  
  - **Rogues' Den**, **Myths' Guild**, **Mor Ul Rek** — fire/stove sites right next to banks are best for 1‑ticking.  
  - **Hosidius Kitchen** — best AFK ranges up to high levels due to reduced burn chance.
- Notable equipment / items  
  - **Raw karambwan**, **raw tuna**, **raw lobster**.  
  - **Cooking gauntlets** (reduce burns for lobster and higher tier fish).  
  - **Steam battlestaff / Tome of Fire** for Bake Pie (unlimited water/fire runes).
- Key unlocks / transitions  
  - Complete **Tai Bwo Wannai Trio** to cook **cooked karambwan** (required for some karambwan methods).  
  - Complete **Easy Kourend & Kebos Diary** to access **Hosidius Kitchen** ranges (5% reduced burn; 10% with Elite diary).

### Level 68–80
Open high‑XP options; jug of wine becomes safe at 68.

- Main training methods  
  - **Jugs of wine** (best from level **68** for full success rate) — very fast XP (200 XP per jug); requires attention while combining grapes + jugs of water.  
  - **Swordfish** or **Monkfish** cooking (good balance of XP and profit/effort).  
  - **Cooked karambwan (1‑tick)** remains top raw XP if you can maintain it.
- Important locations  
  - **Hosidius Kitchen** for AFK fish cooking until high levels.  
  - **Rogues' Den / Myths' Guild** for bank‑adjacent 1‑ticking.
- Notable equipment / items  
  - **Grapes**, **jugs of water** (for jugs of wine).  
  - **Cooking gauntlets** (help for swordfish/monkfish where applicable).  
  - **Tome of Fire / Steam battlestaff** for Bake Pie.
- Key unlocks / transitions  
  - At level **68** wine stops producing bad wine — jug method becomes consistently efficient.  
  - Continue toward **84** to unlock **anglerfish** cooking as an option.

### Level 80–99
Maximize XP with high‑tier fish or continue 1‑tick karambwan.

- Main training methods  
  - **Anglerfish** cooking (prime AFK/profit option from ~84+).  
  - **Sharks** (80–84) or **Manta ray** (91+ alternative).  
  - **1‑tick Cooked karambwan** remains the fastest overall XP method if you can sustain it.  
  - **Jugs of wine** (fast, costly) remains viable throughout.
- Important locations  
  - **Rogues' Den** (best for 1‑ticking — bank adjacent everlasting fire).  
  - **Hosidius Kitchen** (best AFK up to ~96 due to reduced burn chance; after certain levels Rogues' Den may be faster for AFK).  
  - **Myths' Guild / Mor Ul Rek** as alternative stove/range + bank locations.
- Notable equipment / items  
  - **Raw anglerfish / raw shark / raw manta ray**, **raw karambwan**.  
  - **Cooking gauntlets** (required to reach optimal burn rates on high‑tier fish).  
  - **Completion of Kourend & Kebos Diary (Elite)** further reduces burn rates at Hosidius.
- Key unlocks / transitions  
  - **Elite Kourend & Kebos Diary** reduces burn rates (important for high‑tier fish efficiency).  
  - From ~**93–96** consider switching AFK location between **Hosidius** and **Rogues' Den** based on burn rates vs banking time.
