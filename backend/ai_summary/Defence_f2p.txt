### Level 1–20
Train Defence by engaging in **melee combat** on low‑level monsters appropriate for your Attack/Strength.  
- Main training methods: **melee on low‑level monsters** (safe, fast kills to build Defence and Hitpoints).  
- Important locations: **Stronghold of Security** (early safe areas and boot rewards).  
- Notable equipment/items: **fighting/fancy boots** (Stronghold rewards), basic scimitars (bronze → black/mithril as available), **amulet of accuracy** if you lack stronger amulets.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Work toward higher Attack/Strength so you can equip better weapons and armour.

### Level 20–40
Continue melee training on mid‑level monsters; prioritise reaching Attack 40.  
- Main training methods: **melee on mid‑level monsters** with steady kills (keep food to compensate for lower Defence).  
- Important locations: low‑to‑mid level dungeons and monster camps appropriate to your combat stats (use areas where monsters match your Attack/Strength).  
- Notable equipment/items: upgrade weapons (e.g. **adamant scimitar** if available), **amulet of power**/**amulet of strength** (choose by which gives higher max hit/accuracy), better plate/chain options as Defence allows.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: **Attack 40** — unlocks the **rune scimitar** (best DPS in f2p); aim to switch to rune scimitar when possible.

### Level 40–60
Use the rune scimitar and improve armour to tank more hits while training Defence.  
- Main training methods: **melee on higher HP/mid‑level monsters** for consistent Defence and Hitpoints XP (prioritise sustained fights to maximise Defence gains).  
- Important locations: training areas with monsters of appropriate strength (and minimal risk) or alternative higher‑XP areas such as **Demonic Ruins** for **Greater demons** (higher level).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Rune scimitar**, **amulet of strength** or **amulet of power** (whichever yields better max hit/accuracy), **rune chainbody/platebody** and **rune kiteshield** once Defence allows (40 Defence items), **decorative boots (red/white/gold)** as optional upgrades via **Castle Wars**.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: **Defence 40** / **Attack 40** gear tiers — equips full rune pieces and rune kiteshield; switch permanently to rune scimitar for best DPS.

### Level 60+
Focus on efficient, higher‑XP melee targets and AFK‑friendly spots; consider alternative methods for fast gains.  
- Main training methods: **melee on high‑HP or high‑XP monsters** (sustained fights, AFKable where available) and special high‑XP targets like **Greater demons** for experienced players.  
- Important locations: **Demonic Ruins** (Greater demons), minigame hubs for gear (e.g., **Castle Wars** for decorative boots), and safe PvM locations suited to your stats.  
- Notable equipment/items: best free‑to‑play armour set (**rune plate/chainbody**, **rune kiteshield**, **rune scimitar**), **amulet of strength/amulet of power**, **decorative boots** (red/white/gold) for defence/strength upgrades, **gilded d'hide vambraces** only if you have 40 Ranged (otherwise leather/green d'hide/Leather gloves).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: prioritise keeping Attack, Strength, and Defence within ~10 levels of each other for balanced melee performance; use **amulet choices** and **attack style** (aggressive adds hidden Strength) to maximize max hit when training Strength vs Defence.  

### Alternative / utility options (across levels)
- Main methods: hybrid experience + profit or alternative XP spots via minigames/alternative accounts.  
- Important locations: **Castle Wars** (decorative boots), **Clan Wars** / **Castle Wars** alternative accounts for safe training, **Ruins of Camdozaal** (special-case targets like golems) — note **barronite mace** is useful vs certain golems.  
- Notable items: **barronite mace** (situational), **holy symbol** (Prayer bonus utility), **amulet of accuracy** as a cheap interim amulet.  
- Key transitions: use minigames or alternate accounts to obtain defensive gear (boots/shields) or to access high‑XP targets safely.
