Summary (key training methods, locations, and level requirements)

Important training guidance
- Use the best scimitar you can equip — scimitars have the highest DPS in F2P. Prioritise getting Attack 40 to use the rune scimitar as soon as possible.
- Prioritise Strength to increase max hit (and DPS); Attack increases accuracy. The aggressive attack style gives a hidden +3 Strength boost.
- Use the Amulet of Strength or Amulet of Power when available to raise max hit/accuracy (amulet choice depends on Strength level and attack style).
- Wear full melee armour vs melee-using monsters; wear ranged armour vs magic-using monsters. Chainbody is preferable vs crush attacks.
- If you want both experience and survivability while training Defence, equip the best defensive pieces you can wear for your Defence level (see equip levels below).

Relevant locations mentioned
- Stronghold of Security — initial melee boots (Fancy/Fighting boots) can be reclaimed; good for early tanking.
- Castle Wars — obtain decorative boots (red/white/gold) for improved defence (+ gold boots give +1 Strength).
- Ruins of Camdozaal — runecrafting golems (Barronite mace has a special effect against them).
- Demonic Ruins — (listed as an alternative training spot for Greater demons in the full guide).

Other mechanics & notes
- Aggressive attack style grants an effective +3 Strength to damage calculations.
- Amulet bonuses: amulet of power vs amulet of strength trade accuracy vs higher strength bonus — choose based on which gives higher max hit/accuracy at your Strength and attack style.
- Gold decorative boots give a +1 Strength bonus but require significant time/tickets from Castle Wars; not necessary for efficient training.
