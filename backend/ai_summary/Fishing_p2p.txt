### Level 1–24/33
- Main training methods: **Questing** — complete **Sea Slug**, **Fishing Contest**, **Freeing Pirate Pete** for large early XP gains.
- Important locations: quest start points (Sea Slug / Fishing Contest / Recipe for Disaster).
- Notable items: none required for XP skips.
- Key unlocks/transitions: quest XP can skip early grinding (Sea Slug reaches ~level 24; additional quests can push to ~33) and lets you move into **fly fishing** or other methods sooner.

### Level 20–47/58
- Main training methods: **Fly fishing** (3-tick tick-manipulation for **trout**/**salmon**) — fastest pre-58 when using tick methods; AFK alternative past ~35.
- Important locations: **Prifddinas (SE of southern gate)**, **Shilo Village**, **Nemus Retreat**, **Lunch by the lancalliums**, **Farming Guild (SE)**, **Barbarian Village**.
- Notable equipment/items: **Fly fishing rod**, **Feathers** (bait); tick setup items for 3-tick (e.g., **herb** + **swamp tar** or similar).
- Key unlocks/transitions: at level 47 consider switching to **drift net fishing** if also training Hunter; at level 58 **Barbarian Fishing** (leaping salmon) becomes competitive.

### Level 47–99
- Main training methods: **Drift net fishing** (best when training **Hunter** alongside Fishing).
- Important locations: **Fossil Island underwater drift net area** — enter via **Ceto** after **Bone Voyage**.
- Notable equipment/items: **Drift nets** (consumable), **Fishbowl helmet**, **Diving apparatus**, **Flippers**, optional **Merfolk trident/Trident of the Seas/Trident of the Swamp/Dragon harpoon**, **Stamina potions** (run energy).
- Key unlocks/transitions: requires **47 Fishing**, **44 Hunter** and **Bone Voyage**; best when you need Hunter XP — switch away once Hunter is capped or when pure Fishing XP methods (tick methods/harpooning) surpass it.

### Level 58–71/99
- Main training methods: **Barbarian Fishing** (3-tick, cut-eat or drop methods) — fast, grants passive Strength and Agility.
- Important locations: **Pond next to Otto's Grotto** (best), **Mount Quidamortem** (less active alternative with Fish Barrel/banking).
- Notable equipment/items: **Barbarian rod**, bait options (**feathers**, **fish offcuts**, **roe**, **caviar**), tick tools (**herb + tar** or **knife + teak/mahogany logs**), **knife** for cutting fish, **Fish Barrel** optional.
- Key unlocks/transitions: must progress Barbarian Training mini-content to catch leaping fish; need **Agility/Strength 30** for leaping salmon and **45** for leaping sturgeon; before 58 drift nets or 3-tick fly fishing may be faster.

### Level 71–99
- Main training methods: **2-tick harpooning** (swordfish/tuna) — fastest XP when done optimally.
- Important locations: **Port Piscarilius** (rat auto-retaliate method), alternative **Fishing Guild** (PvP world with second account).
- Notable equipment/items: **Harpoon** (prefer **Crystal harpoon**; **Dragon/Infernal/Crystal** variants improve rates), **shortbow (no ammo)** for auto-retaliate setup, **Auto Retaliate** enabled, lure/attacker (rats or alternate account).
- Key unlocks/transitions: method available earlier but becomes top-tier after ~61–71; **crystal harpoon** strongly recommended; Fishing Guild PvP method is faster but riskier.

### Level 35–99 (Alternative / Low-effort)
- Main training methods: **Tempoross** minigame — steady, relatively fast experience with lower effort than tick methods.
- Important locations: **Tempoross** (minigame).
- Notable equipment/items: **Crystal harpoon** improves rates; other harpoon variants usable.
- Key unlocks/transitions: good mid‑to‑high-level alternative — with high Fishing and a crystal harpoon it can rival tick methods for raw XP without intense clicking.
