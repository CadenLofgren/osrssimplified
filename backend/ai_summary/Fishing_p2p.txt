Important training methods (concise), relevant locations, and level/requirement summary:

- Drift net fishing
  - Levels: 47–99 (best when also training Hunter).
  - Requirements: Fishing 47, Hunter 44 (both unboostable), Bone Voyage completed (Fossil Island access), drift nets (consumable), recommended gear: fishbowl helmet, diving apparatus, flippers, trident/merfolk trident, stamina potions; Ceto interaction for entry (costs numulites).

  - Requirements: Partial Barbarian Training completion (to catch leaping fish); barbarian rod and bait (feathers/offcuts/roe/caviar); Agility/Strength: 30 each for leaping salmon, 45 each for leaping sturgeon; tick‑manipulation items for 3‑tick (herb+tar, knife, etc.) for best rates.
  - Locations: Pond next to Otto's Grotto (best); Mount Quidamortem (alternative with Fish Barrel + Chambers of Xeric bank chest).

Notes (essentials only)
- Drift net fishing requires Hunter 44 and Bone Voyage; costs numulites/drift nets if buying on GE.
- Several fast methods rely on tick manipulation (3‑tick for fly/barbarian; 2‑tick harpooning) and require practice and specific setups.
- Many locations require quest unlocks or partial quest completion (Regicide for Prifddinas fly spots, Shilo Village quest for Shilo Village, The Depths of Despair for Lunch teleport, Bone Voyage for Fossil Island, Barbarian Training for barbarian fishing).
