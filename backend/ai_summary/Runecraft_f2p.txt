Summary — free-to-play Runecraft training (important methods, locations, levels)

General
- Use pure essence (cheaper) or rune essence; XP and runes per essence are identical.
- Wear corresponding tiaras to save an inventory slot and allow left-click entry to altars.
- Energy potions restore run energy and significantly increase XP/hr when running.

Air runes
- Levels: start at 1; recommended until level 9.
- Location: Air Altar (just south of Falador). Bank nearby.
- XP: 5 XP per essence (140 XP per 28-essence inventory).
- Notes: Falador Teleport speeds runs for players who can use it (mentioned as available at 37 Magic on the page).

Earth runes
- Levels: unlock at Runecraft 9; recommended 9–14 (or onward depending on route).
- Location: Earth Altar (NE of Varrock, near the sawmill). Use Varrock Teleport to speed bank runs.
- XP: 6.5 XP per essence (182 XP per 28-essence inventory).

Fire runes
- Levels: unlock at Runecraft 14; recommended 14–20.
- Location: Fire Altar (west of Emir's Arena, north of Al Kharid). Closest bank: Al Kharid bank.
- XP: 7 XP per essence (196 XP per 28-essence inventory).
- Notes: Fire runes give less XP/hr than earth runes due to farther bank distance.

Body runes
- Levels: unlock at Runecraft 20; main method from 20 → 99.
- Location: Body Altar (Barbarian Village / Edgeville area). Banking options: Falador or Lumbridge teleports (Lumbridge is the closest bank on PvP worlds).
- XP: 7.5 XP per essence (210 XP per 28-essence inventory).
- Runes per essence: 1 rune per essence at 20–45; 2 runes per essence at 46–91; 3 runes per essence at 92+.

Efficiency improvements for body runes
- Teleport method:
  - Use imbued Skull Sceptre (i) teleport to Barbarian Village, run to altar, then teleport to Falador (or Lumbridge on PvP) to bank.
  - Requires an imbued sceptre (and law/water or earth runes and staff of air depending on setup).
  - Approx rates: ~20,000 XP/hr (non-PvP) with energy potions; ~25,000 XP/hr on PvP worlds.
- Runners (essence runners / alternate accounts):
  - Have other players/accounts run essence to the altar so you only craft.
  - Rates: ~17k XP/hr with 2 runners (no potions); ~24k with 3; up to ~30k with 5.
- Tiara crafting (fastest free-to-play XP):
  - Make tiaras by using a plain tiara + talisman at the altar (tiara making requires 1 Runecraft).
  - Talisman-imbued tiaras give 5× the runecrafting XP for that rune.
  - Best options:
    - Body tiaras: highest XP; optimal method (PvP + skull sceptre (i) + Lumbridge teleport) can reach up to ~47,000 XP/hr. Requires Magic (page lists 31 Magic for the optimal setup), staff of air, law/earth/other runes, and bone fragments to charge sceptre (if using skull sceptre).
    - Earth tiaras: up to ~27,000 XP/hr; requires Varrock Teleport (25 Magic) plus law/fire runes and staff of air.
    - Water tiaras: up to ~25,000 XP/hr; requires Lumbridge Teleport (31 Magic) plus law/earth runes and staff of air.
    - Air tiaras: very slow; mainly for Ironman if collecting air talismans.

Quick requirements recap (as given in the guide)
- Earth runes craftable at Runecraft 9.
- Fire runes craftable at Runecraft 14.
- Body runes craftable at Runecraft 20.
- Tiara crafting: requires a plain tiara + matching talisman used on the altar (tiara creation requires 1 Runecraft).
- Teleport/method-specific Magic requirements cited: Varrock Teleport ~25 Magic; Lumbridge Teleport and some optimal tiara methods cited as 31 Magic; Falador Teleport cited for air returns (page lists 37 Magic).

Practical progression recommendation
- 1 → 9: Air runes at the Air Altar (bank nearby).
- 9 → 14: Earth runes at Earth Altar (use Varrock Teleport if available).
- 14 → 20: Fire runes at Fire Altar (Al Kharid bank).
- 20 → 99: Body runes at Body Altar. Use teleports, runners, or — for fastest XP — craft tiaras (body tiaras best) depending on risk tolerance, Magic level, and whether you use PvP worlds or alternate accounts.
