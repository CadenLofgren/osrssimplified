The content you pasted is just a redirect page and contains no training details. Would you like me to:

- Fetch and summarise the Pay-to-play Ranged training page (important methods, locations, and level requirements), or
- Summarise common p2p Ranged training methods from memory right now?

If you want the summary now, I will produce a concise list of efficient training methods, where to do them, and the Ranged levels required for each. Which do you prefer?
