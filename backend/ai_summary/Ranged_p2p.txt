- Notable equipment/items: **Black/Red/regular chinchompas** (throwables), **Elite Void / Void Ranger helm** (void set) or **Masori armour** (+Zaryte vambraces) for max DPS, **Ava's assembler/accumulator/attractor**, **Rada's blessing**, **Rigour/Deadeye**, **Divine ranging potions**, **Prayer potions** or **Bonecrusher necklace** (Morytania diary).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: access to **Maniacal monkeys** (MMII requirement) enables top-tier chinning rates; consider switching between **void** and **Masori** depending on target defence and cost.

### Level 70–99
- Main training methods: **Pest Control** (points → XP), **Nightmare Zone (NMZ)** AFK setups, continued **chinning/Venator** on monkeys.

### Level 80–99
- Main training methods: **Venator bow on monkeys** (cheap, semi-AFK alternative to chinning), top-end **Chinning** remains fastest if affordable.  
- Important locations: **Kruk's Dungeon (Maniacal monkeys)** — endless spawns for Venator/chinning; **Ape Atoll Dungeon** for skeletons (use salve amulet(ei)).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Masori set + Salve amulet(ei)** (best vs skeletons), **Elite Void** (often best vs maniacal monkeys), **Amethyst/Adamant arrows** as cost-effective options, continued use of **Rigour/Deadeye** and **Divine ranging potions**.
