### Level 70–99
- Main training methods  
  - **Nightmare Zone** (optimal AFK high XP with appropriate gear and overload-style setups)  
  - **Slayer** (high-level tasks such as **Gargoyles** for top melee XP + profit)  
  - **Pest Control** (for **Void Knight equipment**) and specialized monsters (**Scurrius**, **Sulphur Naga**, **Rune dragons** at 90+)
