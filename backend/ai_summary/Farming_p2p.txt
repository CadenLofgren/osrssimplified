### Level 1–20
Main training methods: **Questing** (quest Farming XP), **Bagged plants** (POH), **Making supercompost / ultracompost**, **Allotment runs**, **Sorceress's Garden**.

Important locations: **Player-owned house (Rimmington)** for bagged plants, **Sorceress's Garden**, **Trader Stan's Trading Post** (buy produce for compost).

Notable equipment / items: **Bagged plants**, **Watering cans**, **Coins**, **Filled plant pots**, **Compost bin**, **Volcanic ash** (for ultracompost), **Watermelon / Pineapple** (produce for compost).

Key unlocks / transitions: use quest rewards to skip early levels (several quests grant enough XP to reach ~level 38); switch from active methods (bagged plants / compost) to **tree runs** once you can access useful tree patches (from ~level 15+).

### Level 20–40
Main training methods: begin regular **tree runs** (plant highest-tier saplings available), continue **allotment/herb runs** as supplemental XP.

Important locations: **Tree Gnome Village / The Grand Tree** (spirit tree transport), **Brimhaven**, **Fossil Island** (hardwood patches), **Lletya** (fruit tree patch), early **Farming patches** listed on the Farming map.

Notable equipment / items: **Saplings** (oak → willow → higher tiers), **Spade**, **Gardening trowel**, **Filled plant pots**, **Watering can**, **Ultracompost / supercompost**, **Bottomless compost bucket** (if available), **Teleport tablets / runes** for faster routing.

Key unlocks / transitions: complete transport and patch access quests (e.g., spirit tree quests, **Bone Voyage** for Fossil Island hardwoods, **Tai Bwo Wannai Trio** for calquat access) and start prioritizing fruit / hardwood / special tree saplings in runs.

### Level 40+
Main training methods: primary focus on repeated **tree runs** (trees, fruit trees, hardwoods, special trees); secondary: **herb runs** and **Tithe Farm** if desired for profit/XP.

Important locations: **Farming Guild** (additional tree patch), **Grand Exchange** (buy saplings/seeds), **Prifddinas / crystal tree patch** (via **Song of the Elves**), **Fossil Island** and **Varlamore** hardwood patches, **Brimhaven / Catherby / Falador** patch routings.

Notable equipment / items: high-tier **saplings** (magic, dragonfruit, calquat, celastrus, crystal, redwood, mahogany), **Bottomless compost bucket (full)**, **Spade**, **Eternal teleport crystal / teleport tablets / Skills necklace / Brimhaven/Catherby teleports**, **Gardener protection payments** (or **ultracompost**), **Resurrect Crops** (revive dead trees), **Gardening tools** (trowel, watering can), optional **Dragon axe** / bank/axe tools for tree harvesting.

Key unlocks / transitions: prioritize quest/stat unlocks that improve routing and patches (e.g., **Song of the Elves** for crystal patch, **Mourning's End Part I** for Lletya, **Ribbiting Tale** for extra hardwood patch); get **Construction 40** to move POH to Brimhaven for faster runs and **Magic 40** (or teleport items) for quicker teleports. Buy saplings on the **Grand Exchange** or grow seeds into saplings (seedling → sapling) to reduce cost; use **Humidify** (68 Magic + Dream Mentor) to speed sapling growth if available.
