Summary — key Hunter training methods, locations, and level requirements

Core recurring/AFK methods
- Natural History Quiz — Varrock Museum. Levels 1→9 (grants 1,000 XP). Talk to Orlando Smith in the museum basement.
- Bird house trapping — Fossil Island. Recommended levels: start at 9; fastest up to level 80 (viable to 99). Requirements: Bone Voyage to access Fossil Island. Recommended: digsite pendants for fast travel. Crafting required to make some house types (Crafting level listed below). Hunter level required to place bird houses varies by house (can be boosted):
  - Regular: Crafting 5, Hunter 5
  - Oak: Crafting 15, Hunter 14
  - Willow: Crafting 25, Hunter 24
  - Teak: Crafting 35, Hunter 34
  - Maple: Crafting 45, Hunter 44
  - Mahogany: Crafting 50, Hunter 49
  - Yew: Crafting 60, Hunter 59
  - Magic: Crafting 75, Hunter 74
  - Redwood: Crafting 90, Hunter 89
  (Do runs every 50 minutes; 4 houses per run.)
- Drift net fishing — Fossil Island underwater area (speak to Ceto). Levels required: Hunter 44, Fishing 47 (both unboostable). Requirements: Bone Voyage; optimal gear: fishbowl helmet + diving apparatus + flippers; costs/numulites apply. Best when you want Fishing + Hunter.

Fastest active training methods (level ranges, locations, requirements)
- Feldip weasels — levels 9–13. Location: Feldip Hunter area. Use noose wand + ring(s) of pursuit to track kebbits.
- Desert devils — levels 13–25. Location: Uzer hunter area (near Eagles' Eyrie). Use noose wand + ring of pursuit; bring waterskins for heat.
- Sapphire glacialis (butterflies) — levels 25–37. Location: Mons Gratia (south‑west of mountain peak). Use butterfly net (unequip after level 35 unless using magic net).
- Swamp lizards — levels 37–43. Location: north‑west of Slepe. Use small fishing net + rope per trap (2 traps at 29–39; 3 traps from 40).
- Falconry — levels 43–49. (Falconry minigame; requires a 500 gp fee.)
- Razor‑backed kebbits — levels 49–73. (Kebbit tracking using noose wand and tracking items; multiple kebbit locations.)
- Black chinchompas — levels 73–99. Requires completion of Eagles' Peak for chinchompa hunting; hard Wilderness Diary recommended for fast access.
- Hunter's Rumours — levels 72/91–99. (High‑level passive method; unlocks at specified levels.)

Other viable methods (useful alternatives / mid–high levels)
- Aerial Fishing — levels 35–99 (alternative AFK method).
- Ember‑tailed jerboas — levels 40–59.
- Orange salamanders — levels 47–59.
- Maniacal monkeys — levels 60–99.
- Red salamanders — levels 60–67.
- Black salamanders — levels 67–73.
- Moonlight moths — level 75–99.
- Carnivorous chinchompas — levels 63/80–99. Requirements: Eagles' Peak; ideally Song of the Elves or hard Western Provinces Diary for best access.
- Herbiboar — levels 80–99.

Essential quest/diary prerequisites and notes
- Bone Voyage — required for Fossil Island (bird houses, drift nets).
- Fairytale II (start) — recommended for fairy ring access.
- Eagles' Peak completion — required to catch chinchompas (black/carnivorous).
- Song of the Elves or hard Western Provinces Diary — recommended/preferred for carnivorous chinchompa access.
- Use Hunter potions to temporarily boost Hunter level and to gain extra concurrent traps when boosted past 20/40/60/80 thresholds.

Quick recommendations
- AFK/recurring best: bird house runs on Fossil Island (most XP early→80; do initial unlock run and use digsite pendants).
- Best combined Hunter+Fishing: drift net fishing (44 Hunter / 47 Fishing).
- Fastest active leveling by interval: follow the short progression: Feldip weasels (9–13) → Desert devils (13–25) → Sapphire glacialis (25–37) → Swamp lizards (37–43) → Falconry (43–49) → Razor‑backed kebbits (49–73) → chinchompas / high‑level methods.
