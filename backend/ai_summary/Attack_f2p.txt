### Level 1–20
- Main training methods: Kill **chickens**, **cows**, and low-level **goblins** for fast early Attack/Strength XP and easy food/drops.  
- Important locations: **Lumbridge** (surroundings), **Al-Kharid** (low-level guards/warriors).  
- Notable equipment/items: Use the best scimitar you can equip (e.g. **iron scimitar**, **steel scimitar**), **fancy boots**/**leather boots**, any stat **cape**, and an **amulet of accuracy** if available.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Build up Attack toward **40 Attack** (unlocking the **Rune scimitar**); keep Defence high enough to reduce food usage or bring extra food.

### Level 20–40
- Main training methods: Move to tougher low- to mid-level monsters (higher HP/XP mobs and dungeon creatures) to speed XP—commonly training on **Al-Kharid warriors**, **cows**/larger farm monsters, and dungeon mobs that are safe for your Defence.  
- Important locations: **Edgeville Dungeon** (access to stronger dungeon creatures and Hill Giants), **Lumbridge/Al-Kharid** for nearby options.  
- Notable equipment/items: Upgrade weapon to **mithril/adamant scimitar** when possible; switch between **amulet of accuracy**, **amulet of power**, or **amulet of strength** depending on availability and max-hit calculations; use **leather vambraces**/**leather gloves**.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Prioritise reaching **40 Attack** to equip the **Rune scimitar** (best DPS in F2P). Consider raising Strength to increase max hit and DPS.

### Level 40–60
- Main training methods: Use mid-level dungeon monsters and stronger NPCs for consistent XP (e.g., **Hill Giants** in **Edgeville Dungeon**); focus on training Strength with **Aggressive** attack style when boosting DPS.  
- Important locations: **Edgeville Dungeon**, other safe mid-level dungeons; **Ruins of Camdozaal** if fighting specific golems.  
- Notable equipment/items: Equip the **Rune scimitar** at **40 Attack**; wear **Rune chainbody/platebody** and **Rune kiteshield** once Defence permits; favour **amulet of strength** (best for max hit) or **amulet of power** (accuracy + some strength) depending on which gives higher max hit; consider **barronite mace** for golems (special niche).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: 40 Attack (Rune scimitar) dramatically improves DPS; 40 Defence grants access to top-tier F2P armour pieces; note **Aggressive** attack style gives an effective +3 Strength for max-hit calculation.

### Level 60+
- Main training methods: Continue training on high-HP mid- to high-level monsters that you can tank or kill quickly (dungeon giants/demons where safe); prioritise Strength (or keep melee stats within ~5–10 levels of each other) to maximize DPS.  
- Important locations: **Edgeville Dungeon** (Hill Giants and other strong f2p monsters), **Demonic Ruins** (alternative Greater Demon locations).  
- Notable equipment/items: Continue using **Rune scimitar** as primary weapon; wear full **rune melee armour** for best defence; use **amulet of strength** (best strength bonus) or **amulet of power** if it improves hit chance/max hit; optional upgrades: **decorative boots (red/white/gold)** for higher defence and a small Strength boost (gold boots give +1 Strength).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Maintain or reach high Defence for safer training; prioritize Strength increases to raise maximum hit (strength potions/temporary boosts apply above level 99 but are member-only; note the in-game mechanics for temporary boosts).
