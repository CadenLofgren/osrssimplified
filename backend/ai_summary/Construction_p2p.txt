Important training methods
- Building/removing furniture repeatedly in your Player-Owned House (POH) — the core method for all Construction training (use best plank tier available for speed).
- Levels 1–33 (starter): build low‑level furniture with regular planks (use steel nails) until you can switch to oak. Use Daddy's Home miniquest reward to reach level 8 quickly.
- Level 15+: switch to oak planks for faster XP (no nails).
  - 33–52 (or up to 74): Oak larders in the Kitchen — cheap and efficient for early-mid levels.
  - 74+: Oak dungeon doors (if continuing with oak) for faster oak rates.
- Level 50+: mounted mythical capes (alternative plank use / methods available from 50).
- Level 52–99: Mahogany furniture — fastest viable training from 52.
  - 52–77: Mahogany tables in the Dining room (6 mahogany planks → 840 XP each).
  - 77+: Gnome benches in the Superior garden — highest XP/hr (~1.1M XP/hr) using mahogany planks (6 planks → 840 XP).
  - Use Demon butler cycles (optimal build/remove patterns) for fastest mahogany training.
- Teak options (cost/speed tradeoff):
  - Teak planks usable from 50; Teak garden benches are an option (~levels 66–74 and beyond) as an alternative to mahogany/oak.
- Mahogany Homes (minigame) — alternative 1–99 method (different cost/time tradeoff; good if preferring minigame gameplay).
- Passive/non‑POH XP sources (free/bonus XP that can skip early levels):
  - Fishing Trawler (angler outfit fixes) — grants Construction XP per fix.
  - Wintertodt — grants Construction XP equal to 4× current Construction level (good roughly level 4–27).
  - Vale Totems — grants current level XP per totem.
  - Barlak (Dorgesh‑Kaan) — turn certain bones into Construction XP (requires Death to the Dorgeshuun).

Inventory/efficiency methods (important for speed)
- Phials (Rimmington) — unnote planks quickly while using Rimmington POH (recommended levels 1–40).
- Servants (Servants' Guild, East Ardougne) — much faster than Phials for fetching/unnote:
  - Butler available from level 40; Demon butler available from level 50 (recommended 40+ to hire any servant).
  - Servant's money bag (build in bedroom) at level 58 to auto‑pay servants and skip dialog.
- Carpenter's outfit: +2.5% XP (minor benefit; more relevant for Mahogany Homes).

Relevant locations
- Player‑Owned House (POH) — training location for all build/remove methods; rooms used: Kitchen (oak larder), Dining room (mahogany table), Superior garden (gnome benches), Garden (exit portal).
- Estate agent — buy a POH (Rimmington default portal).
- Phials — for unnoting planks (fast if POH in Rimmington).
- Servants' Guild (East Ardougne) — hire servants (butler/demon butler).
- Bank (for Demon butler to fetch planks).
- Superior garden (inside POH) — gnome bench hotspots.
- Dorgesh‑Kaan — Barlak for bone turning (requires Death to the Dorgeshuun quest).
- Fishing Trawler and Wintertodt minigames — passive XP sources.
