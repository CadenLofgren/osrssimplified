### Level 1–37
Train on **quest rewards** or basic ores for fast early XP.

- Main training methods: **Questing** (quest XP that can get you to 37) or **Copper/Tin** powermining (1–15).  
- Important locations: **Lumbridge Swamp** (easy copper/tin).  
- Notable equipment/items: **Best available pickaxe** (use highest-tier pickaxe you can).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Complete quests (**Doric's Quest**, **The Dig Site**, **Plague City**, **The Giant Dwarf**, **The Lost Tribe**, **Another Slice of H.A.M.**) to skip early grinding and unlock using an **adamant pickaxe** early.

### Level 15–60
Iron is the primary fast-training method; tick-manipulation and pay-to-play options improve rates.

- Main training methods: **Iron powermining** (drop ores); optional **tick manipulation** for higher rates.  
- Important locations: **3-rock triangle spots** (e.g. **Legends' Guild mine**, **Al Kharid Mine**, **Piscatoris Mine**, **Isle of Souls**); **Mining Guild (pay-to-play)** becomes best from level 60.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Best available pickaxe** (upgrade as you can), **Varrock armour 1+** (10% chance to mine 2 ores), **Celestial ring** (interactive +4 Mining boost).  
- Key unlocks/transitions: At level 60 the **Mining Guild pay-to-play area** halves respawn time (better continuous mining); if you don’t plan to learn tick manipulation, consider continuing iron to level 70 before switching methods.

### Level 45–99
Top experience method for skilled players is 3-tick granite; requires setup and click precision.

- Main training methods: **3-tick granite (3t4g)** (fastest XP if you can tick-manipulate); otherwise standard granite or other alternatives below.  
- Important locations: **Quarry (Bandit Camp Quarry)** for granite.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Swamp tar + clean herb** (or equivalent) to set the 3-tick cycle, **Infernal pickaxe** recommended (ore combust chance reduces drops + grants Smithing XP), **Varrock armour 2+** (increases double-ore chance for granite), **Prospector kit** (small XP boost), **Celestial ring**.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Learn **tick manipulation** to effectively use granite; obtain **desert heat protection** (e.g. **Desert amulet 4**) to operate at the Quarry safely.

### Level 30–99 (Alternative: Motherlode)
A low-effort, profitable alternative suitable for long-term AFK-style training.

- Main training methods: **Motherlode Mine** (mine **ore veins**, deposit **pay-dirt** into the hopper/sifter).  
- Important locations: **Motherlode Mine**.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Prospector kit** (set bonus +2.5% Mining XP), **Celestial ring** recommended.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: Accessible from mid levels (around 30); chosen for lower click intensity and profit instead of maximum XP.

### Level 40–99 (Other viable methods and endgame options)
Multiple specialized methods exist for different playstyles (AFK, profitable, or very high XP).

- Main training methods: **Gem rocks** (fast XP on gem nodes), **Calcified rocks**, **Crashed stars**, **Volcanic Mine** (high XP minigame, requires practice), **Zalcano** (group/solo minigame), **Blast Mine** (from 75, high profit/xp with mechanics), **Infernal Shale** (high-rate method from 78), **Amethyst** (mine amethyst from 92).  
- Important locations: **Volcanic Mine**, **Zalcano**, **Blast Mine**, **Crashes/Crashed Star sites**, **Amethyst mine**, various **gem rock** locations.  
- Notable equipment/items: **Crystal pickaxe** (strong for many methods if you can afford shards), **Infernal pickaxe**, **Prospector kit**, **Varrock armour 4** (works for amethyst and grants double-ore chance where applicable), **Expert mining gloves** for amethyst.  
- Key unlocks/transitions: At **70+** you unlock **Volcanic Mine** and **Zalcano** viability; **75** opens **Blast Mine**; **78** enables **Infernal Shale**; **92** unlocks **Amethyst** mining.
