Summary — efficient pay-to-play Mining training (methods, locations, level requirements)

General notes (equipment/boosts that matter)
- Use the best pickaxe you can wield for fastest ticks between rolls (pickaxe tier reduces time between rolls but not success chance). Dragon/infernal/crystal are fastest tiers.
- Infernal pickaxe (req. 61 Mining/85 Smithing to make): 1/3 chance to combust ore (reduces dropping, gives passive Smithing XP) — recommended for fastest methods (granite).
- Crystal pickaxe (req. 71 Mining/50 Agility) is best for some methods but provides no benefit for 3-tick granite (tick manipulation bypasses normal pickaxe timing).
- Prospector kit (full set = +2.5% Mining XP) — low time investment, optional.
- Varrock armour (10% chance double ore) increases XP rates for iron, granite, amethyst (does NOT work in Motherlode, Blast Mine, Volcanic Mine, or on gem rocks).
- Celestial ring (uncharged = +4 Mining boost) is useful for overall XP.

Fastest experience methods (level ranges, locations, requirements, notes)
- Levels 1–37: Questing
  - Complete quest XP rewards (Doric’s Quest, The Dig Site, Plague City, The Giant Dwarf, The Lost Tribe, Another Slice of H.A.M.) to reach level 37 quickly.

- Levels 1–15: Copper/Tin
  - Mine copper/tin anywhere; Lumbridge Swamp is convenient.

- Levels 15–45/70: Iron ore (powermining / drop-mining)
  - Recommended 15–45, or 15–70 if not using tick manipulation (iron is a strong AFK/fast option).
  - Best spots: three-iron-rock triangle spots (allows mining all three without moving). 13 triangle locations:
    - Legends' Guild mine
    - Al Kharid mine
    - Piscatoris mine
    - Lovakengj mine
    - Verdant Valley
    - Mount Karuulm mine
    - Resource Area (Wilderness level 51)
    - South Mor Ul Rek mine
    - Isle of Souls
    - Sisterhood Sanctuary mine
    - The Stranglewood mine
    - Cam Torum mine
    - Salvager Overlook Mine (east)
  - If using tick manipulation, use Legends' Guild or Isle of Souls (4 iron rocks) for advanced 3-tick cycles.
  - Mining Guild (pay-to-play area) becomes best from level 60 (halved respawn) — 70k–80k XP/hr possible at 60+ with good performance.
  - XP rates: ~45k–55k XP/hr below level 60 (no tick manipulation); up to ~70k–80k/hr inside Mining Guild at 60+.

- Levels 45–99: Granite (3-tick granite, "3t4g")
  - Level requirement: 45 to mine granite; method typically starts at 45.
  - Best location: Bandit Camp Quarry (Quarry).
  - Requirement/skill: Tick manipulation (3-tick cycle using swamp tar on a clean herb or other setup) — move between four granite rocks to maintain 3-tick.
  - Desert heat protection required at Quarry (Desert amulet 4, Hitpoints cape + Regen bracelet, waterskins + Humidify, or Circlet of water).
  - Recommended gear: Infernal pickaxe (reduces drops & gives Smithing XP), Varrock armour 2+ increases double-ore chance and Varrock 4 acts as prospector jacket.
  - XP rates:
    - At high efficiency and boosts: up to ~134k XP/hr at 99 (typical ~120k–125k/hr including mistakes).
    - Without tick manipulation: ~63k XP/hr max (so 3-tick is worth learning for best times).

Other notable methods (level ranges from TOC; brief)
- Levels 30–99: Motherlode Mine
  - Low-effort, profitable alternative (mine ore veins, deposit pay-dirt). Recommended for passive/profitable training; prospector kit relevant.

- Levels 40–99: Gem rocks
  - Mining gem rocks for gems; Varrock armour does NOT work on gem rocks.

- Levels 41–99: Calcified rocks
  - Alternative training method (higher-level content).

- Levels 60–99: Crashed stars
  - Distraction/Divination-style activity providing Mining XP.

- Levels 70–99: Volcanic Mine
  - High-level minigame method (reward shop items like prospector kit pieces available).

- Levels 70–99: Zalcano
  - Group or solo activity that gives Mining-related rewards/XP.

- Levels 75–99: Blast Mine
  - Fast and profitable high-level training (different mechanics; rewards & points).

- Levels 78–99: Infernal Shale
  - High-level mining activity (requires level and special mechanics).

- Levels 92–99: Amethyst
  - Amethyst crystals are profitable and decent XP at level 92+; Varrock armour 4 works for amethyst.

Quick recommendations for efficient training
- If you want absolute fastest XP: learn 3-tick granite at the Quarry from level 45 (requires tick manipulation and practice). Use infernal pickaxe and Varrock armour where applicable.
- If you want fast but easier XP: powermine iron at triangle spots (15–70) or in the Mining Guild from 60+.
- If you want low-effort profitable XP: Motherlode Mine (30+), Blast Mine or Volcanic Mine at higher levels depending on rewards and playstyle.
- Use prospector kit and celestial ring if available; Varrock armour when it applies to the method.
