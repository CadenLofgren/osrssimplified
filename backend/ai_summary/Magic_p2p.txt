The provided page is just a redirect to "Pay-to-play Magic training" and contains no training content to extract.

Would you like me to summarize the Pay-to-play Magic training page now? If so, I can produce a concise list of efficient training methods, the locations for each, and the level requirements (e.g., High Alchemy, combat spells like burst/barrage, splashing, teleporting, jewellery/enchantment training).
