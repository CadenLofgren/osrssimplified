Quests (quick early XP)

Relevant locations
- Potter's wheel: Barbarian Village (good wheel; no nearby clay/water). Crafting Guild (level 40) has a potter's wheel and pottery kiln.

- Furnace (for jewellery/smelting): Edgeville (closest to a bank); Al Kharid (short walk from bank).
- Clay & water sources: West Varrock mine (clay), Varrock west bank (near clay/water), Falador waterpump (close to Falador west bank), Varrock center fountain (water close to bank).
- Crafting Guild (requires 40 Crafting): contains clay rocks, water source, potter's wheel, kiln, spinning wheels; sheep for wool just north.
- Ultimate Ironman route (until 40): West Varrock mine → canoe to Edgeville (well) → Barbarian Village wheel/kiln → return; yields ~650–720 XP/run. After 40 use Crafting Guild; mine/smelt gold and craft jewellery for profit while training.

Notes / tips
- Use Crafting Guild from level 40 onward for convenience (all crafting tools and resources in one place) if access permitted.
- For jewellery crafting/smelting, use Edgeville furnace for fastest bank-furnace runs.
- Switch methods as prices/availability change; pottery and leather are inexpensive AFK methods, jewellery/gem cutting give faster XP but require materials and travel to furnaces/banks.
