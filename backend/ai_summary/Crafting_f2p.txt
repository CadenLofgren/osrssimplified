### Level 1–20
Train early Crafting with low-level pottery, leatherwork, and basic jewellery/smelting.

- Main training methods: **making pots**, **pie dishes** (very early), **making bowls** (unlocked at 8), **crafting leather items** (gloves → boots → cowl → vambraces → body), **smelting unstrung gold amulets** (level 8).
- Important locations: **Barbarian Village** potter's wheel (mid-distance to **Varrock** west bank), **Lumbridge** spinning wheel (near Lumbridge bank), **Varrock** water fountain / **Falador** waterpump for clay tasks, **Edgeville** furnace for early jewellery smelting.
- Notable equipment/items: **Soft clay**, **Soft leather**, **Gold bar**, **Chisel** (for cutting gems later), **Potter's wheel**, **Furnace**.
- Key unlocks/transitions: quest XP (Sheep Shearer, Goblin Diplomacy, Misthalin Mystery) gets Crafting up to ~level 8; at level 8 you can make **bowls** and start **gold jewellery** smelting—shift from pottery/leather to jewellery as soon as resources or profit favors it.

### Level 20–40
Shift toward gem-related methods and higher leather/higher-value jewellery.

- Main training methods: **cutting sapphires** (level 20), **cutting emeralds** (27), **crafting gold rings/necklaces/amulets (u)**, **smelting silver for tiaras** (level 23), and progressing leather/upgraded leather items (**leather chaps**, **hard leather body** unlocked at 28).
- Important locations: **Edgeville furnace** (closest furnace-to-bank for jewellery), **Al Kharid** bank → furnace route, **Varrock**/Falador water and clay routes for pottery, **Lumbridge** spinning wheel if using wool/string.
- Notable equipment/items: **Uncut sapphires/emeralds/rubies**, **Gold bars**, **Silver bars** (for tiaras), **Hard leather** (for hard leather body).
- Key unlocks/transitions: start gem-cutting at 20 (fast XP per gem), **hard leather body** available at 28 (good, consistent XP), and prepare to access the **Crafting Guild** at level 40 which consolidates pottery/cloth/clay resources.

### Level 40+
Use the Crafting Guild and switch to higher-tier jewellery and gem work for best XP/profit mix.

- Main training methods: **crafting hard leather bodies** (continuation), **crafting ruby/diamond jewellery** (ruby amulets/necklaces, **diamond cutting** at 43, **diamond necklaces/amulets** at 56+/70+), and continued **gem cutting** for in-place XP.
- Important locations: **Crafting Guild** (level 40 access — contains clay rocks, water source, potter's wheel, kiln, spinning wheels), **Edgeville furnace**, **Varrock west bank**/nearby clay/water routes for commuting.
- Notable equipment/items: **Hard leather**, **Soft clay**, **Gold bars**, **Uncut diamonds/rubies**, **Potter's wheel**, **Furnace**, **Spinning wheel**.
- Key unlocks/transitions: unlocking the **Crafting Guild** at 40 centralizes resources; **cutting diamonds** (43) and **diamond jewellery** production (necklaces at 56, amulets/amulet(u) methods later) provide the highest F2P Crafting XP and are the natural endgame progression.
