General notes (applicable across ranges)
- Main hub for fast smithing in F2P is the **Anvil south of Varrock west bank** due to bank proximity.  
- **Energy potions** in empty inventory slots sustain running to increase XP/hour.  
- At **Magic level 55**, **High Level Alchemy** can be used on created platebodies to reduce cost or recover some gold while training; bring a **Staff of fire** and **Nature runes** if alching on the way to the bank.  
- Use **Dwarven stout** to temporarily boost Smithing by +1 for short windows (useful for accessing higher-tier platebodies one level early).
