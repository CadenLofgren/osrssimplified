### Level 1–26 (Questing)
- Main training methods: **complete quests** that grant Woodcutting XP.
- Important locations: quest start points (varies by quest).

### Level 35–99 (Teak)
- Main training methods: **cut teak trees** — best when using **tick manipulation** (1.5‑tick or 2‑tick methods). Without tick manipulation, cut teaks up to level 65 then consider switching.
- Important locations: **Fossil Island** (planted teaks for 1.5‑tick), **Ape Atoll** / **Isle of Souls** / **Prifddinas** (2‑tick setups).
- Notable equipment/items: **best felling axe** available (dragon felling axe → **crystal felling axe** when accessible), **Forester's rations**, **Forestry / Lumberjack outfit**, **Lightbearer** + **Dragon axe** special (for temporary level boosts).
- Key unlocks/transitions: access to **planted teaks** on **Fossil Island** and 1.5‑tick method (fastest overall); if not using tick manipulation, switch to **sulliuscep** at level 65 for faster XP.

### Level 62–90 (Blisterwood)

- Key unlocks/transitions: accessible at level 62; method is afk‑friendly and never depletes (has intermittent pause mechanic).

### Level 65–99 (Sulliuscep)
- Main training methods: **cut sulliusceps** on **Fossil Island** (fastest non‑tick method).
- Important locations: **Fossil Island — Tar Swamp** (one choppable sulliuscep spawns; world 321 commonly used).
- Notable equipment/items: **dragon / crystal axe**, **Lumberjack outfit**, **regen bracelet**, **Hitpoints cape** (for sustain); bring antipoison/food if needed.
- Key unlocks/transitions: requires **Bone Voyage** to access Fossil Island; recommended switch from teaks at level 65 if not using tick manipulation.

### Level 88–99 (Redwood)
- Main training methods: **cut redwood trees** (low attention, bankable or drop logs for max XP); 1.5‑tick redwood cutting in Farming Guild for high rates if desired.
- Important locations: **Woodcutting Guild** (bank chest), **Farming Guild** redwood patches.
- Notable equipment/items: **infernal / dragon / crystal axe** (crystal gives highest rates), **Lumberjack / Forestry outfits**, **Dragon axe special** + **Lightbearer** + **Preserve** to reliably cut redwoods.
- Key unlocks/transitions: redwoods reliably cut from level 88; at ~89 the Dragon axe special interaction with Lightbearer/Preserve changes usage requirements.
