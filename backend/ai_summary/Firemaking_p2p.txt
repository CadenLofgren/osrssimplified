### Level 1–30
Train on **burning logs on the ground** (start with **Red logs**) or use **campfires** for lower effort.

- Main training methods: **burn logs on ground** (fastest when tick-perfect), **campfires** (automatic ~665 logs/hr; manual up to ~975 logs/hr), **create pyre logs** (if you have Sacred Oil).
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange (east)** — best for mass burning/banking, **Varrock fountain → Varrock west bank**, **Camelot Teleport → Seers' Village** for simpler row-burning.
- Notable equipment/items: **Tinderbox**, **noted logs** (unnote at banker for faster banking), **Red firelighter** (guarantees first-attempt light +10 XP).
- Key notes/transitions: campfires are recommended below ~35 Firemaking due to higher fail rate when lighting on ground; **Shades of Mort'ton** quest is required to access **Sacred oil** for making pyre logs (pyre logs can be made at level 1).

### Level 30–50
Progress through **Willow → Teak → Arctic Pine → Maple** logs; choose between ground burning, campfires, or pyre-log creation up to level 50.

- Main training methods: **burn higher-tier logs on ground** (tick-perfect chaining for max XP), **campfires** (low effort), **creating pyre logs** (uses Sacred Oil; fast with make-all or rapid clicks).
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange (east)** for best space and banking, **Varrock/Seers' Village** methods from earlier still applicable; campfire spots: **Grand Exchange**, **Rogues' Den**, **Crafting Guild**.
- Notable equipment/items: **Willow**, **Teak**, **Arctic Pine**, **Maple logs**, **Sacred oil** (for pyre logs), **noted logs**, **Tinderbox**.
- Key unlocks/transitions: at level 50 you can switch to **Mahogany logs** or join **Wintertodt** (minigame) as alternative training.

### Level 50–75
Use **Mahogany** then **Yew** logs or switch to **Wintertodt** for alternative/AFK-friendly XP.

- Main training methods: **burn Mahogany / Yew logs** on ground for high XP, **campfires** remain viable low-effort option, **Wintertodt** (unlocks at 50 Firemaking) as a cost-effective minigame method.
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange (east)** for fastest ground-burning banking; Wintertodt is at the **Bruma/Harmony** region (access via its minigame).
- Notable equipment/items: **Mahogany logs**, **Yew logs**, **Tinderbox**, continue using **noted logs** for banking; consider **firelighter** if available.
- Key transitions: at 75, **Magic logs** become the next high-XP option.

### Level 75–99
Move to **Magic logs** (75–90) and **Redwood logs** (90–99) for maximum Firemaking XP; mass log burning at the GE is the fastest method for experienced players.

- Main training methods: **burn Magic logs** then **Redwood logs** on ground for top XP rates; **campfires** remain an alternative low-effort method.
- Important locations: **Grand Exchange (east)** for optimal mass-burning/banking; other bank-burning routes (Varrock/Seers') usable if preferred.
- Notable equipment/items: **Magic logs**, **Redwood logs**, **Tinderbox**, **noted/unnoted logs** handling for fast banking, **firelighter** optional.
- Key performance notes: ground-burning can be done tick-perfectly (lighting every 4 ticks) with movement/banking technique (assumes ~1,485 logs/hr); coloured logs have guaranteed success so are safe to burn without campfires.
